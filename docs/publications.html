Making such data publicly available not only helps tackle reproducibility issues in science, it helps make more use of these valuable data. This is especially true for data collected using naturalistic tasks. Here, we describe a dataset collected from a large group of human subjects while they watched a short audiovisual film. The dataset has several unique features. First, it includes a large amount of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (51 participants, age range of 5–55 years, who all performed the same task). Second, it includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings (30 participants, age range of 7–47) during the same task. Eighteen participants performed both iEEG and fMRI versions of the task, non-simultaneously. Third, the data were acquired using a rich audiovisual stimulus, for which …<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01173-0" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><p>Go to

How the brain performs this task in naturalistic listening environments (e.g. with reverberation) is not well understood. In the present paper, we build on the success of deep neural networks at solving complex and high-dimensional problems [1] to develop goal-driven, neurobiological-inspired convolutional neural network (CNN) models of human spatial hearing. After training, we visualize and quantify feature representations in intermediate layers to gain insights into the representational mechanisms underlying sound location encoding in CNNs. Our results show that neurobiological-inspired CNN models trained on real-life sounds spatialized with human binaural hearing characteristics can accurately predict sound location in the horizontal plane.

In countless real-world domains, from legislation and law enforcement to healthcare, such diagnosis is essential to ensure that DNN decisions are driven by aspects appropriate in the context of its use. The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN’s decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field’s complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means “to explain” the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach’s “ability to explain”. This article offers a field guide to explore the space of explainable deep learning for those in the AI/ML field who are uninitiated. The field guide: i) Introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning, ii) discusses the evaluations for model explanations, iii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iv) discusses user-oriented explanation design and future directions. We hope the guide is seen as a starting point for those embarking on this research field.<a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/13200" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><p>Go to

It postulates that the brain continuously inhibits predictable sensory input, ensuring a preferential processing of surprising elements. A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge asa consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input. Moving beyond the view of purely top-down driven predictions, we furthermore demonstrate, via virtual lesioning experiments, that networks perform predictions on two timescales: fast lateral predictions among sensory units, and slower prediction cycles that integrate evidence over time.<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3976481" rel="noreferrer"

Typically, a brain–computer interface (BCI) is calibrated using user-and session-specific data because of the individual idiosyncrasies and the non-stationary signal properties of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Therefore, it is normal for BCIs to undergo a time-consuming passive training stage that prevents users from directly operating them. In this study, we systematically reduce the training data set in a stepwise fashion, to ultimately arrive at a calibration-free method for a code-modulated visually evoked potential (cVEP)-based BCI to fully eliminate the tedious training stage. Approach. In an extensive offline analysis, we compare our sophisticated encoding model with a traditional event-related potential (ERP) technique. We calibrate the encoding model in a standard way, with data limited to a single class while generalizing to all others and without any data. In addition, we investigate the feasibility of …<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/abecef/meta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><p>Go to

Code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEP) have been consolidated in recent years as robust control signals capable of providing non-invasive brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) for reliable, high-speed communication. Their usefulness for communication and control purposes has been reflected in an exponential increase of related articles in the last decade. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature to gain understanding of the existing research on c-VEP-based BCIs, since its inception (1984) until today (2021), as well as to identify promising future research lines. Approach. The literature review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. After assessing the eligibility of journal manuscripts, conferences, book chapters and non-indexed documents, a total of 70 studies were included …<a

One way of investigating the mechanisms of DLD language problems is to compare language-related brain activation patterns of children with DLD to those of a population with similar language difficulties and a uniform etiology. Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) constitute such a population. Here, we conducted an fMRI study, in which children (6-10yo) with DLD and 22q11DS listened to speech alternated with reversed speech. We compared language laterality and language-related brain activation levels with those of typically developing (TD) children who performed the same task. The data revealed no significant differences between groups in language lateralization, but task-related activation levels were lower in children with …<a

It models the neural computations in multiple brain regions and can be trained end-to-end via stochastic gradient descent from noninvasive data. NIF models represent neural information processing via a network of coupled tensors, each encoding the representation of the sensory input contained in a brain region. The elements of these tensors can be interpreted as cortical columns whose activity encodes the presence of a specific feature in a spatiotemporal location. Each tensor is coupled to the measured data specific to a brain region via low-rank observation models that can be decomposed into the spatial, temporal and feature receptive fields of a localized neuronal population. Both these observation models and the convolutional weights defining the information processing within regions are learned end-to-end by predicting the neural signal during sensory stimulation. We trained a NIF model on the activity of early visual areas using a large-scale fMRI dataset recorded in a single participant. We show that we can recover plausible visual representations and population receptive fields that are consistent with empirical findings.<a

However, the performance of the variational approach depends on the choice of an appropriate variational family. Here, we introduce automatic structured variational inference (ASVI), a fully automated method for constructing structured variational families, inspired by the closed-form update in conjugate Bayesian models. These pseudo-conjugate families incorporate the forward pass of the input probabilistic program and can therefore capture complex statistical dependencies. Pseudo-conjugate families have the same space and time complexity of the input probabilistic program and are therefore tractable for a very large family of models including both continuous and discrete variables. We validate our automatic variational method on a wide range of both low-and high-dimensional inference problems. We find that ASVI provides a clear improvement in performance when compared with other popular approaches such as mean field family and inverse autoregressive flows. We provide a fully automatic open source implementation of ASVI in TensorFlow Probability.<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/ambrogioni21a.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><p>Go to

Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data. These programs can be constructed automatically from an input probabilistic program and can also be amortized automatically. We evaluate the performance of the new variational programs in a series of structured inference problems. We find that cascading flows have much higher performance than both normalizing flows and ASVI in a large set of structured inference problems.<a

Here we present a new method for reconstructing naturalistic images and videos from very large single-participant functional magnetic resonance imaging data that leverages the recent success of image-to-image transformation networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial information obtained from retinotopic mappings across the visual system. More specifically, we first determine what position each voxel in a particular region of interest would represent in the visual field based on its corresponding receptive field location. Then, the 2D image representation of the brain activity on the visual field is passed to a fully convolutional image-to-image network trained to recover the original stimuli using VGG feature loss with an adversarial regularizer. In our experiments, we show that our method offers a significant improvement over existing video reconstruction techniques.<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.02.429430.abstract"

However, many real world applications require the use of domain-specific knowledge, which normalizing flows cannot readily incorporate. We propose embedded-model flows (EMF), which alternate general-purpose transformations with structured layers that embed domain-specific inductive biases. These layers are automatically constructed by converting user-specified differentiable probabilistic models into equivalent bijective transformations. We also introduce gated structured layers, which allow bypassing the parts of the models that fail to capture the statistics of the data. We demonstrate that EMFs can be used to induce desirable properties such as multimodality, hierarchical coupling and continuity. Furthermore, we show that EMFs enable a high performance form of variational inference where the structure of the prior model is embedded in the variational architecture. In our experiments, we show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in common structured inference problems.<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06021" rel="noreferrer"

The theory of Bayes-adaptive exploration offers an attractive optimality framework for training machines to perform complex information gathering tasks. However, the computational complexity of the resulting optimal control problem has limited the diffusion of the theory to mainstream deep AI research. In this paper we exploit the inherent mathematical structure of Bayes-adaptive problems in order to dramatically simplify the problem by making the reward structure denser while simultaneously decoupling the learning of exploitation and exploration policies. The key to this simplification comes from the novel concept of cross-value (i.e. the value of being in an environment while acting optimally according to another), which we use to quantify the value of currently available information. This results in a new denser reward structure that &quot;cashes in&quot; all future rewards that can be predicted from the current information state. In a set of experiments we show that the approach makes it possible to learn challenging information gathering tasks without the use of shaping and heuristic bonuses in situations where the standard RL algorithms fail.<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08518" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><p>Go to article</p></a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></main></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"publicationData":[{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"What determines vision?

The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN’s decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field’s complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means “to explain” the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach’s “ability to explain”. This article offers a field guide to explore the space of explainable deep learning for those in the AI/ML field who are uninitiated. The field guide: i) Introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning, ii) discusses the evaluations for model explanations, iii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iv) discusses user-oriented explanation design and future directions.

It postulates that the brain continuously inhibits predictable sensory input, ensuring a preferential processing of surprising elements. A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge asa consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input. Moving beyond the view of purely top-down driven predictions, we furthermore demonstrate, via virtual lesioning experiments, that networks perform predictions on two timescales: fast lateral predictions among sensory units, and slower prediction cycles that integrate evidence over time."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"n57ygVkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=3873756733302774912","cites_id":["3873756733302774912"],"pub_url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3976481","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:gBzKkjlZwjUJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":5,"2022":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"A visual brain-computer interface as communication aid for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","pub_year":2021,"author":"Ceci Verbaarschot and Daniëlle Tump and Andreea Lutu and Marzieh Borhanazad and Jordy Thielen and Philip van den Broek and Jason Farquhar and Janneke Weikamp and Joost Raaphorst and Jan T Groothuis and Peter Desain","journal":"Clinical Neurophysiology","volume":"132","number":"10","pages":"2404-2415","publisher":"Elsevier","abstract":"Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) spellers that make use of code-modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP) may provide a fast and more accurate alternative to existing visual BCI spellers for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

The elements of these tensors can be interpreted as cortical columns whose activity encodes the presence of a specific feature in a spatiotemporal location. Each tensor is coupled to the measured data specific to a brain region via low-rank observation models that can be decomposed into the spatial, temporal and feature receptive fields of a localized neuronal population.

Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data.

In this paper we exploit the inherent mathematical structure of Bayes-adaptive problems in order to dramatically simplify the problem by making the reward structure denser while simultaneously decoupling the learning of exploitation and exploration policies. The key to this simplification comes from the novel concept of cross-value (i.e. the value of being in an environment while acting optimally according to another), which we use to quantify the value of currently available information. This results in a new denser reward structure that \"cashes in\" all future rewards that can be predicted from the current information state.

This work builds on such a local learning algorithm - Gradient Adjusted Incremental Target Propagation (GAIT-prop) - which has recently been shown to approximate BP in a manner which appears biologically plausible. This method constructs local, layer-wise weight update targets in order to enable plausible credit assignment.

We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex).

The ELEPHANT study presents an alternative clinical trial design with a daily randomized approach evaluating individualized tonotopical fitting of a cochlear implant (CI). A single-blinded, daily-randomized clinical trial will be implemented to evaluate a new imaging-based CI mapping strategy. A minimum of 20 participants will be included from the start of the rehabilitation process with a 1-year follow-up period. Based on a post-operative cone beam CT scan (CBCT), mapping of electrical input will be aligned to natural place-pitch arrangement in the individual cochlea. The CI’s frequency allocation table will be adjusted to match the electrical stimulation of frequencies as closely as possible to corresponding acoustic locations in the cochlea. A randomization scheme will be implemented whereby the participant, blinded to the intervention allocation, crosses over between the experimental and standard fitting program on a daily basis, and thus effectively acts as his own control, followed by a period of free choice between both maps to incorporate patient preference. With this new approach the occurrence of a first-order carryover effect and a limited sample size is addressed. The experimental fitting strategy is thought to give rise to a steeper learning curve, result in better performance in challenging listening situations, improve sound quality, better complement residual acoustic hearing in the contralateral ear and be preferred by recipients of a CI.

An alternative called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural network into layer-wise and plausible ‘targets’ for every unit. These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically, backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9IABpQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC","num_citations":12,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=15875049954561764197","cites_id":["15875049954561764197"],"pub_url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/7ba0691b7777b6581397456412a41390-Abstract.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:ZSs89dKBT9wJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":2,"2021":8,"2022":2}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Hyperrealistic neural decoding: Reconstruction of face stimuli from fMRI measurements via the GAN latent space","pub_year":2020,"author":"Thirza Dado and Yağmur Güçlütürk and Luca Ambrogioni and Gabriëlle Ras and Sander E Bosch and Marcel van Gerven and Umut Güçlü","abstract":"We introduce a new framework for hyperrealistic reconstruction of perceived naturalistic stimuli from brain recordings.

These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass.

Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts. During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information. Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs and using 24 extracted features per USV, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features.

For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection.

In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature.

Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data. These programs can be constructed automatically from an input probabilistic program and can also be amortized automatically. We evaluate the performance of the new variational programs in a series of structured inference problems. We find that cascading flows have much higher performance than both normalizing flows and ASVI in a large set of structured inference problems."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"BKRLVogAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=16991650093300670925","cites_id":["16991650093300670925"],"pub_url":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/ambrogioni21a.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:zWHr9rt3zusJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":4}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Embedded-model flows: Combining the inductive biases of model-free deep learning and explicit probabilistic modeling","pub_year":2021,"author":"Gianluigi Silvestri and Emily Fertig and Dave Moore and Luca Ambrogioni","journal":"arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.06021","abstract":"Normalizing flows have shown great success as general-purpose density estimators.

Accidents have been reported in situations where the automated driving technology was not able to function according to specifications. As data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming more ubiquitous in automated vehicles, it is increasingly important to make AI systems situational aware. One aspect of this is determining whether these systems are competent in the current and immediate traffic situation, or that they should hand over control to the driver or safety system.We aim to increase the safety of automated driving functions by combining data-driven AI systems with knowledge-based AI into a hybrid-AI system that can reason about competence in the traffic state now and in the next few seconds.

The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN’s decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field’s complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means “to explain” the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach’s “ability to explain”.

To this end, automated vehicles must not only be functionally safe. They should also be perceived as driving safely by other traffic participants and have a positive impact on traffic safety. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no consensus yet on what “driving safely” means. This article proposes a new characterization of safe driving behavior for automated vehicles based on models of “typical” human driving behavior. Such behavior (specially from attentive, experienced drivers) is known to lead to interactions of mid to low severity (i.e., low collision risk). Automated vehicles displaying similar behavior would interact with other traffic participants in a recognizable, predictable, and safe way.

The pRF model is used for estimating retinotopy, defining functional localizers and to study a vast amount of cognitive tasks. In a classic pRF, the cartesian location and receptive field size are modeled as a 2D Gaussian kernel in visual space and are estimated by optimizing the fit between observed responses and predicted responses. In the standard framework this is achieved using an iterative gradient descent algorithm. This optimization is time consuming because the number of pRFs to fit (e.g., fMRI voxels) is typically large. This computation time increases further with the complexity of the pRF model (e.g., adding HRF parameters, surround suppression and uncertainty measures). Here, we introduce DeepRF, which uses deep convolutional neural networks to estimate pRFs. We compare the performance of DeepRF with that of the conventional method using a synthetic dataset for which the ground truth is known and an empirical dataset. We show that DeepRF achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than the conventional method.

The resulting forward amortized variational inference is a likelihood-free method as its gradient can be sampled without bias and without requiring any evaluation of either the model joint distribution or its derivatives. We prove that our new variational loss is optimized by the exact posterior marginals in the fully factorized mean-field approximation, a property that is not shared with the more conventional reverse KL inference. Furthermore, we show that forward amortized inference can be easily marginalized over large families of latent variables in order to obtain a marginalized variational posterior. We consider two examples of variational marginalization. In our first example we train a Bayesian forecaster for predicting a simplified chaotic model of atmospheric convection. In the second example we train an amortized variational approximation of a Bayesian optimal classifier by marginalizing over the model space.

Current research is focused on the contribution of animal models for understanding human spatial audition, the effects of behavioural demands on neural sound location encoding, the emergence of a cue-independent location representation in the auditory cortex, and the relationship between single-source and concurrent location encoding in complex auditory scenes. Furthermore, computational modelling seeks to unravel how neural representations of sound source locations are derived from the complex binaural waveforms of real …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"l1vEmKMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC","num_citations":32,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=18196024213832332372","cites_id":["18196024213832332372"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-019-0206-5","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:VPThpZ1DhfwJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":1,"2020":6,"2021":18,"2022":7},"mandates":[{"agency":"US National Institutes of Health","url_policy":"https://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nih-2021-02-13.pdf","effective_date":"2008/4","embargo":"12 months","acknowledgement":" …US National Institutes of Health (grant numbers R01EY018923 and R01DC014989 …"},{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (VICI grant number 453–12–002) …"},{"agency":"US National Science Foundation","url_policy":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15052/nsf15052.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nsf-2021-02-13.pdf","effective_date":"2016/1","embargo":"12 months","acknowledgement":" …US National Science Foundation (PIRE grant number OISE-0730255 …"},{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","acknowledgement":" …European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant number 645553) …"},{"agency":"German Research Foundation","url_policy":"https://www.dfg.de/formulare/2_012e/2_012e.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/dfg_de-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2006/1","embargo":"12 months","acknowledgement":" …German Excellence Initiative …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Decoding of emotion expression in the face, body and voice reveals sensory modality specific representations.","pub_year":2019,"author":"Maarten Vaessen and Kiki van der Heijden and Beatrice de Gelder","journal":"bioRxiv","pages":"869578","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","abstract":"A central issue in affective science is whether the brain represents the emotional expressions of faces, bodies and voices as abstract categories in which auditory and visual information converge in higher order conceptual and amodal representations. This study explores an alternative theory based on the hypothesis that under naturalistic conditions where affective signals are acted upon that rather than reflected upon, major emotion signals (face, body, voice) have sensory specific brain representations. During fMRI recordings, participants were presented naturalistic dynamic stimuli of emotions expressed in videos of either the face or the whole body, or voice fragments. To focus on automatic emotion processing and bypass explicit emotion cognition relying on conceptual processes, participants performed an unrelated target detection task presented in a different modality than the stimulus. Using multivariate analysis to asses neural activity patterns in response to emotion expressions in the different stimuli types, we show a distributed brain organization of affective signals in which distinct emotion signals are closely tied to the sensory origin. Our findings are consistent with the notion that under ecological conditions the various sensory emotion expressions have different functional roles, even when from an abstract conceptual vantage point they all exemplify the same emotion category."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"l1vEmKMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC","num_citations":2,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=9886700957911833425","cites_id":["9886700957911833425"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/869578.abstract","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:UVvZpCOeNIkJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":1,"2021":1},"mandates":[{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","acknowledgement":" …H2020-EU. 1.2.2 …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Complex-valued Gaussian process regression for time series analysis","pub_year":2019,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Eric Maris","journal":"Signal Processing","volume":"160","pages":"215-228","publisher":"Elsevier","abstract":"The construction of synthetic complex-valued signals from real-valued observations is an important part of many time series analysis techniques.

The pRF model is used for estimating retinotopy, defining functional localizers and to study a vast amount of cognitive tasks. In a classic pRF, the cartesian location and receptive field size are modeled as a 2D Gaussian kernel in visual space and are estimated by optimizing the fit between observed responses and predicted responses. In the standard framework this is achieved using an iterative gradient descent algorithm. This optimization is time consuming because the number of pRFs to fit (e.g., fMRI voxels) is typically large. This computation time increases further with the complexity of the pRF model (e.g., adding HRF parameters, surround suppression and uncertainty measures). Here, we introduce DeepRF, which uses deep convolutional neural networks to estimate pRFs. We compare the performance of DeepRF with that of the conventional method using a synthetic dataset for which the ground truth is known and an empirical dataset. We show that DeepRF achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than the conventional method. This enables easier and faster modeling of more complex pRF models, resolving an important limitation of the conventional approach."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9IABpQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=17701423681495685738","cites_id":["17701423681495685738"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/732990.abstract","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:ato8Wg0XqPUJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":2,"2021":2},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …VIDI grant (639.072.513) …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Forward amortized inference for likelihood-free variational marginalization","pub_year":2019,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Umut Güçlü and Julia Berezutskaya and Eva van den Borne and Yaǧmur Güçlütürk and Max Hinne and Eric Maris and Marcel van Gerven","conference":"The 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics","pages":"777-786","publisher":"PMLR","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new form of amortized variational inference by using the forward KL divergence in a joint-contrastive variational loss.

The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9IABpQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=809998739564452645","cites_id":["809998739564452645"],"pub_url":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/ambrogioni18a.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:JdtA5I-xPQsJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":2,"2021":2}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Explanation methods in deep learning: Users, values, concerns and challenges","pub_year":2018,"author":"Gabriëlle Ras and Marcel van Gerven and Pim Haselager","pages":"19-36","publisher":"Springer, Cham","abstract":"Issues regarding explainable AI involve four components: users, laws and regulations, explanations and algorithms.

During perception, visual activity is characterized by distinct processing stages, but the temporal dynamics underlying imagery remain unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of visual imagery in human participants using magnetoencephalography. Firstly, we show that, compared to perception, imagery decoding becomes significant later and representations at the start of imagery already overlap with later time points. This suggests that during imagery, the entire visual representation is activated at once or that there are large differences in the timing of imagery between trials. Secondly, we found consistent overlap between imagery and perceptual processing around 160 ms and from 300 ms after stimulus onset. This indicates that the N170 gets reactivated during imagery and that imagery does not rely on early perceptual representations.

Current available literature on the use of deep learning in person re-identification focus on improving large dataset benchmarks with large gallery sizes, while improving the CMC ranking on individual benchmarks using very deep neural networks. While CMC ranking is a good test of the discriminative ability of a network, not much is known about the TPR and FPR performance of smaller deep neural networks in situations with small gallery sizes. In this study we found that as the gallery size increases, the ranking performance of the network goes down while the TPR and FPR remain similar. We show that a relatively small neural network can achieve similar performance on benchmark as very deep neural network, assuming that the gallery is small enough (≤300 IDs). We achieve a performance of 50% on ViPER, 56% on PRID450 and 21% on Market1501. Most literature use simple distance metrics such as the L2 or Euclidean distance between the extracted image features to perform metric learning. However, neural metric learning has not been a topic of investigation, which if used, can results in a more natural approach to person reidentification by having a neural network learn the boundary between (mis)match classes.

We thus run a MCMC analysis, using the observations of quasars and the electron scattering optical depth to the CMB to constrain a number of free parameters, including a scale factor applied to the simulation escape fraction results, a contribution from AGN, minimum halo mass for star formation …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"DyumFosAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AAS...22934704F/abstract","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Re (con) volution: accurate response prediction for broad-band evoked potentials-based brain computer interfaces","pub_year":2017,"author":"Jordy Thielen and P Marsman and Jason Farquhar and Peter Desain","pages":"35-42","publisher":"Springer, Cham","abstract":"Broad-band evoked potentials (BBEPs) are responses to non-periodic stimuli, evoked in reponse to carefully chosen pseudo-random noise-sequences (PRNS).

With reconvolution, one can then generate responses to any other novel PRNS. In this chapter, we discuss three approaches to reconvolution: (1) a sequential approach, (2) an integrated approach, and (3) a zero-training approach.

We link the trial-by-trial dynamics of EEG oscillatory activity during movement preparation to the corresponding dynamics in perception, for two unrelated visual and motor tasks. The phase of theta oscillations (~4 Hz) predicts perceptual performance, even \u003e1 s before movement. Moreover, theta oscillations are phase-locked to the onset of the movement. Remarkably, the alignment of theta phase and its perceptual relevance unfold with similar non-monotonic profiles, suggesting their relatedness.

We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training points. The weights are determined by the outer layer of a deep neural network, trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling. In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally, our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture, the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the quantized softmax approach."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9IABpQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C","num_citations":23,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=10047485456764185500","cites_id":["10047485456764185500"],"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07111","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:nCtVAMrWb4sJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":5,"2020":4,"2021":8,"2022":4}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"GP CaKe: Effective brain connectivity with causal kernels","pub_year":2017,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Max Hinne and Marcel Van Gerven and Eric Maris","journal":"Neural Information Processing Systems 2017","abstract":"A fundamental goal in network neuroscience is to understand how activity in one brain region drives activity elsewhere, a process referred to as effective connectivity.

The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the analysis of measured brain signals."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9IABpQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=4980228194260473950","cites_id":["4980228194260473950"],"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05243","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:XthHAyhTHUUJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2017":2,"2018":0,"2019":2,"2020":1,"2021":0,"2022":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Bayesian model ensembling using meta-trained recurrent neural networks","pub_year":2017,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Y Berezutskaya and Umut Güçlü and Eva WP van den Borne and Yagmur Güçlütürk and Marcel AJ van Gerven and EGG Maris","publisher":"[Sl: sn]","abstract":"In this paper we demonstrate that a recurrent neural network meta-trained on an ensemble of arbitrary classification tasks can be used as an approximation of the Bayes optimal classifier.

We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training points. The weights are determined by the outer layer of a deep neural network, trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling. In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally, our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture, the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the quantized softmax approach."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:lg5bARUibhcC","num_citations":23,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=10047485456764185500","cites_id":["10047485456764185500"],"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07111","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:nCtVAMrWb4sJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":5,"2020":4,"2021":8,"2022":4}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Visualizing apparent personality analysis with deep residual networks","pub_year":2017,"author":"Yagmur Gucluturk and Umut Guclu and Marc Perez and Hugo Jair Escalante and Xavier Baro and Isabelle Guyon and Carlos Andujar and Julio Jacques Junior and Meysam Madadi and Sergio Escalera and Marcel AJ Van Gerven and Rob Van Lier","conference":"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops","pages":"3101-3109","abstract":"The real world application scenarios for automatic prediction of apparent personality traits are vast and fall within a wide range of domains such as entertainment, health, human computer interaction, recruitment and security.

The approach combines the tractability and flexibility of autoregressive modeling with the biophysical interpretability of dynamic causal modeling. The causal kernels are learned nonparametrically using Gaussian process regression, yielding an efficient framework for causal inference. We construct a novel class of causal covariance functions that enforce the desired properties of the causal kernels, an approach which we call GP CaKe. By construction, the model and its hyperparameters have biophysical meaning and are therefore easily interpretable. We demonstrate the efficacy of GP CaKe on a number of simulations and give an example of a realistic application on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:2Zz6vCQtBj4C","num_citations":13,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=15022246851777834148","cites_id":["15022246851777834148"],"pub_url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/9cf81d8026a9018052c429cc4e56739b-Abstract.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:pKxyoOu9edAJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2018":2,"2019":4,"2020":2,"2021":5}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Deep adversarial neural decoding","pub_year":2017,"author":"Yağmur Güçlütürk and Umut Güçlü and Katja Seeliger and Sander Bosch and Rob van Lier and Marcel van Gerven","journal":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.07109","abstract":"Here, we present a novel approach to solve the problem of reconstructing perceived stimuli from brain responses by combining probabilistic inference with deep learning.

In recent years, Gaussian process regression has attracted substantial attention as a robust and powerful method for analyzing time series. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing nonstationary time series using locally stationary Gaussian process analysis with parameters that are coupled through a hidden Markov model. The main advantage of this framework is that arbitrary complex nonstationary covariance functions can be obtained by combining simpler stationary building blocks whose hidden parameters can be estimated in closed-form. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by analyzing two examples of synthetic nonstationary signals: oscillations with time varying frequency and time series with two dynamical states.

After stimulus offset, a peak in information was observed, comparable to the peak after stimulus onset. Moreover, similar processes, albeit not identical, seemed to underlie both peaks. Information about the categorical identity of the stimulus remained present until 677 ms after stimulus offset, during which period the stimulus had to be retained in working memory.

This motivates the idea that the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the connection profiles of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar connection profiles together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar connection profiles consist of regions that have previously been identified as the ‘rich club’; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments.

This coupled activity is conveniently expressed using covariance, but this measure fails to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. A popular alternative that addresses this issue is partial correlation, which regresses out the signal of potentially confounding variables, resulting in a measure that reveals only direct connections. Importantly, provided the data are normally distributed, if two variables are conditionally independent given all other variables, their respective partial correlation is zero. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model that allows us to estimate functional connectivity in terms of both partial correlations and a graph representing conditional independencies. Simulation results show that this methodology is able to outperform the graphical LASSO, which is the de facto standard for estimating partial correlations. Furthermore, we apply the model to estimate functional connectivity for twenty subjects using resting-state fMRI data.

To overcome the challenge of formalizing what stimulus features should modulate single voxel responses, we introduce a general approach for making directly testable predictions of single voxel responses to statistically adapted representations of ecologically valid stimuli. These representations are learned from unlabeled data without supervision. Our approach is validated using a parsimonious computational model of (i) how early visual cortical representations are adapted to statistical regularities in natural images and (ii) how populations of these representations are pooled by single voxels. This computational model is used to predict single voxel responses to natural images and identify natural images from stimulus-evoked multiple voxel responses. We show that statistically adapted low-level sparse and invariant representations of natural images better span the space of early visual cortical representations and can be more effectively exploited in stimulus identification than hand-designed Gabor wavelets.

Participants systematically scanned search displays consisting of six small Landolt Cs in search of Cs with a particular orientation. After each search display, they indicated whether and where target Cs had been presented. As expected, an FRP component consistent with the P300 reliably distinguished between target and nontarget fixations. It was possible to classify single FRPs into target and nontarget FRPs above chance (on average 62% correct, where 50% would be chance).

We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance.  Approach We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a covert orientation discrimination task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3.5°) or far (7°) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block.  Main Results Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1.85 s and 2.25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65.9%) than in the easy task condition (61.1%). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate.  Significance Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand.

Furthermore, many paradigms use intense visual stimulation, which can be irritating especially in long BCI sessions. However, BCIs can more directly directly tap the neural processes underlying visual attention. Covert shifts of visual attention induce changes in oscillatory alpha activity in posterior cortex, even in the absence of visual stimulation. The aim was to investigate whether different pairs of directions of attention shifts can be reliably differentiated based on the electroencephalogram. To this end, healthy participants (N = 8) had to strictly fixate a central dot and covertly shift visual attention to one out of six cued directions. Covert attention shifts induced a prolonged alpha synchronization over posterior electrode sites (PO and O electrodes). Spectral changes had specific topographies so that different pairs of directions could be differentiated. There was substantial variation across participants with respect to the direction pairs that could be reliably classified. Mean accuracy for the best-classifiable pair amounted to 74.6%. Furthermore, an alpha power index obtained during a relaxation measurement showed to be predictive of peak BCI performance (r = .66). Results confirm posterior alpha power modulations as a viable input modality for gaze-independent EEG-based BCIs. The pair of directions yielding optimal performance varies across participants.

While technical developments obviously are important, we will here argue that new insight gained from cognitive neuroscience can be used to identify signatures of neural activation which reliably can be modulated by the subject at will. This review will focus mainly on oscillatory activity in the alpha band which is strongly modulated by changes in covert attention. Besides developing BCIs for their traditional purpose, they might also be used as a research tool for cognitive neuroscience. There is currently a strong interest in how brain state fluctuations impact cognition. These state fluctuations are partly reflected by ongoing oscillatory activity. The functional role of the brain state can be investigated by introducing stimuli in real time to subjects depending on the actual state of the brain. This principle of brain-state dependent stimulation may also be used as a practical tool for augmenting human behavior. In conclusion, new approaches based on online analysis of ongoing brain activity are currently in rapid development.

In this paper we study the effect of target eccentricity on the performance of a brain computer interface system that is driven by covert attention.

The cosmic reionisation of hydrogen has been the last major phase transition in the evolution of the Universe, turning cool neutral gas into the hot, ionised plasma we observe today. Up to now, direct observations of reionisation have been impossible, most of our current knowledge therefore stems from numerical studies. However, even with current computing facilities the modelling of the reionisation epoch presents some serious challenges. Radiative transfer is perhaps the biggest challenge, due to the high dimensionality and non-locality of the problem. In this thesis the latest improvements of the SimpleX method, that was designed to overcome some of the problems related to radiative transfer, are presented. We have used this method to study the escape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies. Our results show that high-redshift dwarf galaxies can be important contributors to cosmic reionisation. In addition, we have studied the effect of the inclusion of diffuse recombination radiation in reionisation simulations on large scales, which has been neglected by recent studies. We show that diffuse recombination radiation does not have a significant influence on the reionisation process."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"DyumFosAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC","num_citations":1,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=9317399698924164130","cites_id":["9317399698924164130"],"pub_url":"https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/16247","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:ItS0FKkNToEJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2018":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Identifying object categories from event-related EEG: toward decoding of conceptual representations","pub_year":2010,"author":"Irina Simanova and Marcel Van Gerven and Robert Oostenveld and Peter Hagoort","journal":"PloS one","volume":"5","number":"12","pages":"e14465","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Multivariate pattern analysis is a technique that allows the decoding of conceptual information such as the semantic category of a perceived object from neuroimaging data.

In contrast, multivariate approaches that use classification as a basis are well-suited to detect such interactions, allowing the analysis of neuroimaging data on the single trial level. However, multivariate approaches typically assign a non-zero contribution to every component, making interpretation of the results troublesome. This paper introduces groupwise regularisation as a novel method for finding sparse, and therefore easy to interpret, models that are able to predict the experimental condition to which single trials belong. Furthermore, the obtained models can be constrained in various ways by placing features extracted from the data that are thought to belong together into groups.

A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge asa consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input. Moving beyond the view of purely top-down driven predictions, we furthermore demonstrate, via virtual lesioning experiments, that networks perform predictions on two timescales: fast lateral predictions among sensory units, and slower prediction cycles that integrate evidence over time."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:ZxXHo_Hcam8C","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=3873756733302774912","cites_id":["3873756733302774912"],"pub_url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3976481","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:gBzKkjlZwjUJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":5,"2022":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Automatic variational inference with cascading flows","pub_year":2021,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Gianluigi Silvestri and Marcel Van Gerven","conference":"International Conference on Machine Learning","pages":"254-263","publisher":"PMLR","abstract":"The automation of probabilistic reasoning is one of the primary aims of machine learning. Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data. These programs can be constructed automatically from an input probabilistic program and can also be amortized automatically. We evaluate the performance of the new variational programs in a series of structured inference problems. We find that cascading flows have much higher performance than both normalizing flows and ASVI in a large set of structured inference problems."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:3utUx_xxzcoC","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=16991650093300670925","cites_id":["16991650093300670925"],"pub_url":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/ambrogioni21a.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:zWHr9rt3zusJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":4}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"A nested cortical hierarchy of neural states underlies event segmentation in the human brain","pub_year":2021,"author":"Linda Geerligs and Marcel van Gerven and Karen L Campbell and Umut Güçlü","journal":"bioRxiv","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","abstract":"A fundamental aspect of human experience is that it is segmented into discrete events.

Using an innovative data-driven state segmentation method, we investigate how neural states are organized across the cortical hierarchy and where in cortex neural state and perceived event boundaries overlap. Our results show that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions and long states in anterior temporal pole and lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Neural state boundaries overlap with event boundaries across large parts of this hierarchy. State boundaries are shared within and between groups of brain regions that resemble well known functional networks, such as the default mode network that fractionates into two subnetworks – one fast, one slow.

In contrast, the human brain is able to efficiently learn effective control strategies using limited resources. This raises the question whether insights from neuroscience can be used to improve current RL methods. Predictive processing is a popular theoretical framework which maintains that the human brain is actively seeking to minimize surprise. We show that recurrent neural networks which predict their own sensory states can be leveraged to minimise surprise, yielding substantial gains in cumulative reward. Specifically, we present the Predictive Processing Proximal Policy Optimization (P4O) agent; an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that applies predictive processing to a recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm by integrating a world model in its hidden state. P4O significantly outperforms a baseline recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm on multiple Atari games using a single GPU. It also outperforms other state-of-the-art agents given the same wall-clock time and exceeds human gamer performance on Seaquest, which is a particularly challenging environment in the Atari domain. Altogether, our work underscores how insights from the field of neuroscience may support the development of more capable and efficient artificial agents.Supplementary Material: zip6 RepliesLoading"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:MappHbsApxQC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=zz_qjE6N1OF","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:prxy_Sx5sjMJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Brain-inspired learning drives advances in neuromorphic computing","pub_year":2021,"author":"Nasir Ahmad and Bodo Rueckauer and Marcel van Gerven","journal":"ERCIM News","number":"125","pages":"24-25","publisher":"EUROPEAN RESEARCH CONSORTIUM INFORMATICS \u0026 MATHEMATICS","abstract":"The success of deep learning is founded on learning rules with biologically implausible properties, entailing high memory and energy costs.

In the last decade, a number of investigations have been carried out focused upon determining whether alternative more biologically plausible computations can be used to approximate BP. This work builds on such a local learning algorithm - Gradient Adjusted Incremental Target Propagation (GAIT-prop) - which has recently been shown to approximate BP in a manner which appears biologically plausible. This method constructs local, layer-wise weight update targets in order to enable plausible credit assignment. However, in deep networks, the local weight updates computed by GAIT-prop can deviate from BP for a number of reasons. Here, we provide and test methods to overcome such sources of error. In particular, we adaptively rescale the locally-computed errors and show that this significantly increases the performance and stability of the GAIT-prop algorithm when applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:vxVQT5kDUaMC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11598","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:XnwGO71aK90J:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Stem en spraak","pub_year":2021,"author":"ACM Rietveld and M van Gerven","publisher":"Assen: Koninklijke Van Gorcum","abstract":"Stem en spraak Toggle navigation Radboud Repository Toggle navigation View Item Radboud \nRepository Collections Radboud University Academic publications View Item Radboud Repository \nCollections Radboud University Academic publications View Item Search Repository This \nCollection BrowseAll of RepositoryCollectionsDepartmentsDate IssuedAuthorsTitlesDocument \ntypeThis CollectionDepartmentsDate IssuedAuthorsTitlesDocument type StatisticsView Item \nStatistics Stem en spraak Find Full text Publication year 2021 Author(s) Rietveld, ACM Gerven, \nM. van Publisher Assen : Koninklijke van Gorcum ISBN 9789023257769 In Hadders-Algra, \nM.; Pangalila, RF (ed.), Kinderrevalidatie, pp. 133-148 Publication type Part of book or chapter \nof book Please use this identifier to cite or link to this item: https://hdl.handle.net/2066/241247 \nhttps://hdl.handle.net/2066/241247 Display more details Upload full text Use …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:kFIFcbgrf0oC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/241247","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Hyperrealistic neural decoding of faces","pub_year":2021,"author":"TM Dado and Y Güçlütürk and L Ambrogioni and GEH Ras and SE Bosch and MAJ van Gerven and U Güçlü","publisher":"Piscataway, NJ: IEEE EMBS","abstract":"We show how generative modeling approximates the neural (face) manifold by obtaining state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived face images from fMRI activations."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:Kr09a2QcR50C","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/240575","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"DeNovoCNN: A deep learning approach to de novo variant calling in next generation sequencing data","pub_year":2021,"author":"Gelana Khazeeva and Karolis Sablauskas and Bart van der Sanden and Wouter Steyaert and Michael Kwint and Dmitrijs Rots and Max Hinne and Marcel van Gerven and Helger Yntema and Lisenka Vissers and Christian Gilissen","journal":"bioRxiv","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","abstract":"De novo mutations (DNMs) are an important cause of genetic disorders. The accurate identification of DNMs from sequencing data is therefore fundamental to rare disease research and diagnostics. Unfortunately, identifying reliable DNMs remains a major challenge due to sequence errors, uneven coverage, and mapping artifacts. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) DNM caller (DeNovoCNN), that encodes alignment of sequence reads for a trio as 160×164 resolution images. DeNovoCNN was trained on DNMs of whole exome sequencing (WES) of 2003 trios achieving on average 99.2% recall and 93.8% precision. We find that DeNovoCNN has increased recall/sensitivity and precision compared to existing de novo calling approaches (GATK, DeNovoGear, Samtools) based on the Genome in a Bottle reference dataset. Sanger validations of DNMs called in both exome and genome datasets confirm that DeNovoCNN outperforms existing methods. Most importantly, we show that DeNovoCNN is robust against different exome sequencing and analyses approaches, thereby allowing it to be applied on other datasets.

Using the Wasserstein variational inference framework, we introduce several new forms of autoencoders and test their robustness and performance against existing variational autoencoding techniques."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:r_AWSJRzSzQC","num_citations":33,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=6451924518029579411","cites_id":["6451924518029579411"],"pub_url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/2c89109d42178de8a367c0228f169bf8-Abstract.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:k1TJVirXiVkJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2018":1,"2019":6,"2020":13,"2021":11,"2022":2}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Resting-state subcortical functional connectivity in HIV-infected patients on long-term cART","pub_year":2017,"author":"Marloes AM Janssen and Max Hinne and Ronald J Janssen and Marcel A van Gerven and Stefan C Steens and Bozena Góraj and Peter P Koopmans and Roy PC Kessels","journal":"Brain Imaging and Behavior","volume":"11","number":"5","pages":"1555-1560","publisher":"Springer US","abstract":"Despite long-term successful treatment with cART, impairments in cognitive functioning are still being reported in HIV-infected patients.

Despite this, with the exception of the C. elegans roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied ex vivo. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a ‘latent space model’ that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque, where we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two baselines and an alternative model in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex.

This motivates the idea that the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the connection profiles of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar connection profiles together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar connection profiles consist of regions that have previously been identified as the ‘rich club’; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments.

This coupled activity is conveniently expressed using covariance, but this measure fails to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. A popular alternative that addresses this issue is partial correlation, which regresses out the signal of potentially confounding variables, resulting in a measure that reveals only direct connections. Importantly, provided the data are normally distributed, if two variables are conditionally independent given all other variables, their respective partial correlation is zero. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model that allows us to estimate functional connectivity in terms of both partial correlations and a graph representing conditional independencies. Simulation results show that this methodology is able to outperform the graphical LASSO, which is the de facto standard for estimating partial correlations. Furthermore, we apply the model to estimate functional connectivity for twenty subjects using resting-state fMRI data. Results show that our model provides a richer representation of functional connectivity as compared to considering partial correlations alone.

We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance.Approach: We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a covert orientation discrimination task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3.5 u) or far (7u) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block.Main Results: Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1.85 s and 2.25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65.9%) than in the easy task condition (61.1%). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate.Significance: Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand.

Evidence from rodent electrophysiology studies suggests that the hippocampus plays a central role in coordinating the reactivation of neocortical memory representations during post-encoding offline periods. However, evidence from human neuroimaging studies is scarce and it remains unclear at which timescales offline memory reactivation occurs. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate changes in the resting-state brain connectivity pattern following a sequence learning task. Participants were required to remember several multi-item sequences, comprising alternating face and scene or faceless body stimuli. Preliminarily results suggest learning-induced changes in fMRI and source space MEG resting-state connectivity when comparing post-encoding rest with preexperimental baseline periods. Specifically, we observe increased correlation between the hippocampus and specialized ventral visual regions processing the categorical sequence stimuli.  Moreover, the stimulus-specific connectivity pattern across regions during encoding appears to show increased similarity to the connectivity pattern observed during post-encoding relative to the baseline rest period. These preliminary findings are in line with evidence suggesting hippocampus mediated neocortical reactivation of recently acquired information during subsequent offline periods.

These measures require an estimate of whole-brain structural connectivity for which one may resort to deterministic or thresholded probabilistic streamlining procedures. While these procedures have provided important insights about the characteristics of human brain networks, they ultimately rely on unwarranted assumptions such as those of noise-free data or the use of an arbitrary threshold. Therefore, resulting structural connectivity estimates as well as derived graph measures fail to fully take into account the inherent uncertainty in the structural estimate. In this paper, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining posterior distributions over graph metrics using Bayesian inference. It is shown that this posterior distribution can be used to quantify uncertainty about graph-theoretical measures at the single subject level, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the graph-theoretical properties of human brain connectivity.

It is unclear whether the host immune system has a direct influence on parasite gene expression. The parasite is known to secrete proteins that are thought to manipulate the host immune system. An open question is whether the malaria parasite regulates these proteins in response to immune system pressure. A recent study of Daily et al.[2] shows that in vivo parasite gene expression from 35 patients can be classified into three clusters. Besides expression data, Daily et al. collected sixteen patient characteristics, some of which are significantly different between the clusters (rank order test).We take an integrated probabilistic approach by predicting the malaria parasite cluster based on patient characteristics and their interactions. As the number of predictors (136) is larger than the number of patients, we use L1-regularized multinomial logistic regression. We find that the interaction of immune signaling molecules TNFα and TGFα explain cluster membership best, consistent with the notion that parasite gene expression reacts to immune system pressure."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"http://adrianabirlutiu.uab.ro/pubs/conf/2010malaria.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:dS8kiAVJScoJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES FOR BCI","author":"A Bahramisharif and M van Gerven and O Jensen and T Heskes","abstract":"Brain computer interfacing (BCI) is a general term that is used for a direct connection between the brain and a computer [1].

However, BP relies on the global transmission of gradient information and has therefore been criticised for its biological implausibility. We propose constrained parameter inference (COPI) as a new principle for learning. COPI allows for the estimation of network parameters under the constraints of decorrelated neural inputs and top-down perturbations of neural states. We show that COPI not only is more biologically plausible but also provides distinct advantages for fast learning, compared with standard backpropagation of error."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13203","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Optimization of Neuroprosthetic Vision via End-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning","pub_year":2022,"author":"Burcu Küçükoğlu and Bodo Rueckauer and Nasir Ahmad and Jaap de Ruyter van Steveninck and Umut Güçlü and Marcel van Gerven","journal":"bioRxiv","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","abstract":"Visual neuroprostheses are a promising approach to restore basic sight in visually impaired people. A major challenge is to condense the sensory information contained in a complex environment into meaningful stimulation patterns at low spatial and temporal resolution.

As an alternative approach, we propose to optimize stimulation patterns by end-to-end training of a feature extractor using deep reinforcement learning agents in virtual environments. We present a task-oriented evaluation framework to compare different stimulus generation mechanisms, such as static edge-based and adaptive end-to-end approaches like the one introduced here. Our experiments in Atari games show that stimulation patterns obtained via task-dependent end-to-end optimized reinforcement learning result in equivalent or improved performance compared to fixed feature extractors on high difficulty levels.

Unfortunately, identifying reliable DNMs remains a major challenge due to sequence errors, uneven coverage, and mapping artifacts. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) DNM caller (DeNovoCNN), that encodes alignment of sequence reads for a trio as 160×164 resolution images. DeNovoCNN was trained on DNMs of whole exome sequencing (WES) of 2003 trios achieving on average 99.2% recall and 93.8% precision. We find that DeNovoCNN has increased recall/sensitivity and precision compared to existing de novo calling approaches (GATK, DeNovoGear, Samtools) based on the Genome in a Bottle reference dataset. Sanger validations of DNMs called in both exome and genome datasets confirm that DeNovoCNN outperforms existing methods. Most importantly, we show that DeNovoCNN is robust against different exome sequencing and analyses approaches, thereby allowing it to be applied on other datasets.

It postulates that the brain continuously inhibits predictable sensory input, ensuring a preferential processing of surprising elements. A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge asa consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input. Moving beyond the view of purely top-down driven predictions, we furthermore demonstrate, via virtual lesioning experiments, that networks perform predictions on two timescales: fast lateral predictions among sensory units, and slower prediction cycles that integrate evidence over time."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=3873756733302774912","cites_id":["3873756733302774912"],"pub_url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3976481","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:gBzKkjlZwjUJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":5,"2022":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"P4O: Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with Predictive Processing Proximal Policy Optimization","pub_year":2021,"author":"Burcu Küçükoğlu and Walraaf Borkent and Bodo Rueckauer and Nasir Ahmad and Umut Güçlü and Marcel van Gerven","abstract":"Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) often rely on massive compute resources and remain notoriously sample inefficient. In contrast, the human brain is able to efficiently learn effective control strategies using limited resources. This raises the question whether insights from neuroscience can be used to improve current RL methods. Predictive processing is a popular theoretical framework which maintains that the human brain is actively seeking to minimize surprise. We show that recurrent neural networks which predict their own sensory states can be leveraged to minimise surprise, yielding substantial gains in cumulative reward. Specifically, we present the Predictive Processing Proximal Policy Optimization (P4O) agent; an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that applies predictive processing to a recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm by integrating a world model in its hidden state. P4O significantly outperforms a baseline recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm on multiple Atari games using a single GPU. It also outperforms other state-of-the-art agents given the same wall-clock time and exceeds human gamer performance on Seaquest, which is a particularly challenging environment in the Atari domain. Altogether, our work underscores how insights from the field of neuroscience may support the development of more capable and efficient artificial agents.Supplementary Material: zip6 RepliesLoading"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=zz_qjE6N1OF","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:prxy_Sx5sjMJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Brain-inspired learning drives advances in neuromorphic computing","pub_year":2021,"author":"Nasir Ahmad and Bodo Rueckauer and Marcel van Gerven","journal":"ERCIM News","number":"125","pages":"24-25","publisher":"EUROPEAN RESEARCH CONSORTIUM INFORMATICS \u0026 MATHEMATICS","abstract":"The success of deep learning is founded on learning rules with biologically implausible properties, entailing high memory and energy costs.

However, its reliance on non-local information in propagating error gradients makes it seem an unlikely candidate for learning in the brain. In the last decade, a number of investigations have been carried out focused upon determining whether alternative more biologically plausible computations can be used to approximate BP. This work builds on such a local learning algorithm - Gradient Adjusted Incremental Target Propagation (GAIT-prop) - which has recently been shown to approximate BP in a manner which appears biologically plausible. This method constructs local, layer-wise weight update targets in order to enable plausible credit assignment. However, in deep networks, the local weight updates computed by GAIT-prop can deviate from BP for a number of reasons. Here, we provide and test methods to overcome such sources of error. In particular, we adaptively rescale the locally-computed errors and show that this significantly increases the performance and stability of the GAIT-prop algorithm when applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11598","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:XnwGO71aK90J:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Neural encoding with affine feature response transforms","pub_year":2021,"author":"U.

Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex). Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:ypg3kOuG8gIC","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=10977080310325828461","cites_id":["10977080310325828461"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007992","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:bdvnF2JsVpgJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":1,"2021":3,"2022":2},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …NWO Gravitation grant 024.001.006) …"},{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","grant":"Advanced iConnect Project Grant ADV 320708"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Visual attention through uncertainty minimization in recurrent generative models","pub_year":2020,"author":"Kai Standvoss and Silvan C Quax and Marcel AJ van Gerven","journal":"BioRxiv","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","abstract":"Allocating visual attention through saccadic eye movements is a key ability of intelligent agents.

Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts. During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information.Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features.

We demonstrate the usefulness of the ICP on learning the structure of deep generative sigmoid networks as well as convolutional neural networks."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v124/dallaire20a.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:sjqPz5puk38J:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Gait-prop: A biologically plausible learning rule derived from backpropagation of error","pub_year":2020,"author":"Nasir Ahmad and Marcel A van Gerven and Luca Ambrogioni","journal":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","volume":"33","pages":"10913-10923","abstract":"Traditional backpropagation of error, though a highly successful algorithm for learning in artificial neural network models, includes features which are biologically implausible for learning in real neural circuits. An alternative called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural network into layer-wise and plausible ‘targets’ for every unit. These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically, backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC","num_citations":12,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=15875049954561764197","cites_id":["15875049954561764197"],"pub_url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/7ba0691b7777b6581397456412a41390-Abstract.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:ZSs89dKBT9wJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":2,"2021":8,"2022":2}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Overcoming the Weight Transport Problem via Spike-Timing-Dependent Weight Inference","pub_year":2020,"author":"Nasir Ahmad and Luca Ambrogioni and Marcel AJ van Gerven","journal":"arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.03988","abstract":"We propose a solution to the weight transport problem, which questions the biological plausibility of the backpropagation algorithm.

The pRF model is used for estimating retinotopy, defining functional localizers and to study a vast amount of cognitive tasks. In a classic pRF, the cartesian location and receptive field size are modeled as a 2D Gaussian kernel in visual space and are estimated by optimizing the fit between observed responses and predicted responses. In the standard framework this is achieved using an iterative gradient descent algorithm. This optimization is time consuming because the number of pRFs to fit (e.g., fMRI voxels) is typically large. This computation time increases further with the complexity of the pRF model (e.g., adding HRF parameters, surround suppression and uncertainty measures). Here, we introduce DeepRF, which uses deep convolutional neural networks to estimate pRFs. We compare the performance of DeepRF with that of the conventional method using a synthetic dataset for which the ground truth is known and an empirical dataset. We show that DeepRF achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than the conventional method.

We prove that our new variational loss is optimized by the exact posterior marginals in the fully factorized mean-field approximation, a property that is not shared with the more conventional reverse KL inference.

In this work, we report how the effectiveness of modulating the early processing stage of an artificial neural network depends on the information bottleneck faced by the network. The bottleneck is quantified by the number of tasks the network has to perform and the neural capacity of the later stage of the network. The effectiveness is gauged by the performance on multiple object detection tasks, where the network is trained with a recent multi-task optimization scheme.

Attention is both influenced through bottom-up stimulus properties as well as top-down task demands. The interaction of these two attention mechanisms is not yet fully understood. A parsimonious reconciliation posits that both processes serve the minimization of predictive uncertainty. We propose a recurrent generative neural network model that predicts a visual scene based on foveated glimpses. The model shifts its attention in order to minimize the uncertainty in its predictions. We show that the proposed model produces naturalistic eye-movements focusing on salient stimulus regions. Introducing the additional task of classifying the stimulus, modulates the saccade patterns and enables effective image classification.

Most studies lack a good control check to verify whether eye movements are causing an effect found in the MEG signal. Therefore, it remains unclear how much of an influence eye movements can have on observed effects in MEG. We find that we can decode stimulus location from eye movements in two different stages of a working memory match-to-sample task that encompass different areas of research typically done with MEG. This means that  the observed MEG effect might be (partly) due to eye movements instead of any true neural correlate.

Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense.

A Bayesian hierarchical model was used, allowing us to simultaneously study group-level effects as well as effects for individual participants. We found strong effects of both imagery as well as its interaction with sensory evidence within individual participants. However, the direction of these effects were highly variable between individuals, leading to weak effects at the group level. This highlights the heterogeneity of conscious perception and emphasizes the need for individualized investigation of such complex cognitive processes."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/209329","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Competitive learning in rate coded and spiking neural networks models with applications to vision and audition","pub_year":2019,"author":"Nasir Ahmad","abstract":"Competitive learning is a common and successful approach used to train unsupervised rate-based neural network models. We apply such a technique in this thesis and produce a rate-coded neural network model of pitch processing which provides insights into the training protocols necessary to develop robust pitch representations. However, the extension of reliable unsupervised competitive learning approaches from rate-coded to spiking neural networks has proven challenging, especially when biological plausibility and detail are desired. Transitioning to spiking neural network models is made more difficult by the comparatively high computational cost and complexity of these network models compared to rate-based models.We describe a transition from rate-based to spiking neural network models and address these outstanding issues. First, we focus on increasing simulation efficiency. We develop a state of the art graphical processing unit (GPU) based spiking neural network simulator which adopts optimisations from central processing unit (CPU) and cluster-based simulators. In benchmarks, we show that our novel simulator is capable of simulation speeds up to an order of magnitude greater than contemporary simulators. This greater simulation speed is intended to enable a higher throughput of spiking neural network simulations and thereby accelerate research. In order to ensure that present and future simulators can be efficiently and effectively compared, we also compile a repository of benchmarks which allow validation of simulator performance and simulated neural network dynamics.Having developed efficient simulation …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC","num_citations":0,"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed5434ec-cfe4-43b9-93e5-e07d5617b042","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:S77wVj0m1lcJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{},"mandates":[{"agency":"UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","url_policy":"https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/UKRI-020920-OpenAccessPolicy.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/ukri_uk-2021-02-13.pdf","effective_date":"2013/4","embargo":"6 months","acknowledgement":" …Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)[grant number BB/J014427/1] …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Emergent mechanisms of evidence integration in recurrent neural networks","pub_year":2018,"author":"Silvan Quax and Marcel van Gerven","journal":"PLoS One","volume":"13","number":"10","pages":"e0205676","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Recent advances in machine learning have enabled neural networks to solve tasks humans typically perform. These networks offer an exciting new tool for neuroscience that can give us insight in the emergence of neural and behavioral mechanisms. A big gap remains though between the very deep neural networks that have risen in popularity and outperformed many existing shallow networks in the field of computer vision and the highly recurrently connected human brain. This trend towards ever-deeper architectures raises the question why the brain has not developed such an architecture. Besides wiring constraints we argue that the brain operates under different circumstances when performing object recognition, being confronted with noisy and ambiguous sensory input. The role of time in the process of object recognition is investigated, showing that a recurrent network trained through reinforcement learning is able to learn the amount of time needed to arrive at an accurate estimate of the stimulus and develops behavioral and neural mechanisms similar to those found in the human and non-human primate literature."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:2hfDYGh-f1UC","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=762177505972357846","cites_id":["762177505972357846"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205676","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:1opGS2fMkwoJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":5,"2021":1},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","grant":"639.072. 513"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"New advances in encoding and decoding of brain signals.","pub_year":2018,"author":"Chris I Baker and Marcel van Gerven","publisher":"Elsevier Science","abstract":"This editorial focuses on new advances in encoding and decoding of brain signals.

Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts, for instance courtship, territorial dispute, dominance and mother-pup interaction. Previous studies have pointed to differences in the USVs in different context, sexes, strains and individuals, however, in many cases the outcomes of the analyses remained inconclusive.We here provide a more general approach to automatically classify USVs using deep neural networks (DNN). We classified the sex of the emitting mouse (C57Bl/6) based on the vocalization’s spectrogram, reaching unprecedented performance (~84% correct) in comparison with other techniques (Support Vector Machines: 64%, Ridge regression: 52%). Vocalization characteristics of individual mice only contribute mildly, and sex-only classification reaches ~78%. The performance can only partially be explained by a set of classical shape features, with duration, volume and bandwidth being the most useful predictors. Splitting estimation into two DNNs, from spectrograms to features (57-82%) and features to sex (67%) does not reach the single-step performance.In summary, the emitter’s sex can be successfully predicted from their spectrograms using DNNs, excelling over other classification techniques. In contrast to previous research, this suggests that male and female vocalizations differ in their spectrotemporal structure, recognizable even in single vocalizations."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:KFIQUvoPKFAC","num_citations":3,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=1977860050484646715","cites_id":["1977860050484646715"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/358143.abstract","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:O9OSnDzFchsJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":2,"2020":0,"2021":1},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …NWO …"},{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","acknowledgement":" …Marie-Sklodowska Curie grant (# 660328) …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Driving the locus coeruleus: relating pupil diameter to performance on a naturalistic highway driving task","pub_year":2018,"author":"Andrew T Reid and Marcel van Gerven","journal":"F1000Research","volume":"7","abstract":"Copyright© 2018 Reid AT and van Gerven M.

Concretely, we show that if the data can be described in terms of N finite sets and the used activation function f is non-constant, increasing and has a left asymptote, we can derive how many nodes are needed to linearly separate these sets. This will be an upper bound that depends on the structure of the data. This structure can be analyzed using an algorithm.

These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Here, using the dominant causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=16624586736659722395","cites_id":["16624586736659722395"],"pub_url":"https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/nue4z/providers/osfstorage/5be33ffce057c600170d72cb?action=download\u0026version=1\u0026displayName=centrality-causality-2018-11-07T19:41:48.986Z.pdf\u0026direct","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:m_BFYI5ltuYJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":1,"2020":3}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Contributed Discussion","pub_year":2018,"author":"Max Hinne and Ronald J Janssen and Reza Mohammadi","volume":"13","number":"4","pages":"1304-1306","publisher":"INT SOC BAYESIAN ANALYSIS"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8538386192200298626\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=scholarr","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Semi-Analytic Nonparametric Bayesian Inference for Spike-Spike Neuronal Connectivity","pub_year":2018,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Patrick Ebel and Max Hinne and Umut Guclu and Marcel van Gerven and Eric Maris","abstract":"Estimating causal connectivity between spiking neurons from measured spike sequences is one of the main challenges of systems neuroscience.

As a result, a single second of simulation time requires many thousands of update calculations per neuron. Furthermore, increases in the scale of SNN models have, accordingly, led to manyfold increases in the runtime of SNN simulations. Existing solutions to this problem of scale include high performance CPU based simulators capable of multithreaded execution (“CPU parallelism”). More recent GPU based simulators have emerged, which aim to utilise GPU parallelism for SNN execution. We have identified several key speedups, which give GPU based simulators up to an order of magnitude performance increase over CPU based simulators on several benchmarks. We present the Spike simulator with three key optimisations: timestep grouping, active synapse grouping, and delay insensitivity. Combined, these optimisations massively increase the speed of executing a SNN simulation and produce a simulator which is, on a single machine, faster than currently available simulators."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"J9HOU6YAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=9563982074505779399","cites_id":["9563982074505779399"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/461160.abstract","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:x9geTQYXuoQJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":1,"2021":3},"mandates":[{"agency":"UK Economic and Social Research Council","url_policy":"https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/UKRI-020920-OpenAccessPolicy.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/ukri_uk-2021-02-13.pdf","effective_date":"2013/4","embargo":"12 months","acknowledgement":" …Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(grant no.

Despite this, with the exception of the C. elegans roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied ex vivo. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a ‘latent space model’ that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque, where we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two baselines and an alternative model in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex.

The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems.

Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feedforward sweep across the visual hierarchy between 75-200 ms after stimulus onset. This spatiotemporal cascade was captured by the network layer representations, where the increasingly abstract stimulus representation in the hierarchical network model was reflected in different parts of the visual cortex, following the visual ventral stream.

We propose a new Bayesian method for linear model identification with a structured prior (GMEP) aiming to apply it as linear regression method in the context of the parametric Granger causal inference. GMEP assumes a Gaussian scale mixture distribution for the group sparsity prior and it enables flexible definition of the coefficient groups. Approximate posterior inference is achieved using Expectation Propagation for both the linear coefficients and the hyperparameters. GMEP is investigated both on simulated data and on empirical fMRI data in which we show how adding information on the sparsity structure of the coefficients positively improves the inference process. In the same simulation framework, GMEP is compared with others standard linear regression methods. Moreover, the causal inferences derived from GMEP estimates and from a standard Granger method are compared across simulated datasets of different dimensionality, density connection and level of noise. GMEP allows a better model identification and consequent causal inference when prior knowledge on the sparsity structure are integrated in the structured prior."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:10ZmGoIvuzkC","num_citations":2,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=9485192681206364361","cites_id":["9485192681206364361"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177359","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:ybhwJX0sooMJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2018":2},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","grant":"639.072. 513"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Bayesian model ensembling using meta-trained recurrent neural networks","pub_year":2017,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Y Berezutskaya and Umut Güçlü and Eva WP van den Borne and Yagmur Güçlütürk and Marcel AJ van Gerven and EGG Maris","publisher":"[Sl: sn]","abstract":"In this paper we demonstrate that a recurrent neural network meta-trained on an ensemble of arbitrary classification tasks can be used as an approximation of the Bayes optimal classifier.

The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning. In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:D8wXzuvKacYC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01437","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"fMRI measurements of visual imagery and perception of different categories.","pub_year":2017,"author":"N Dijkstra and SE Bosch and MAJ van Gerven","publisher":"Radboud Data Repository","abstract":"The data were collected while participants performed a retro-cue working memory type of task.

Each neuroimaging technique has its own assumptions and weaknesses [Jones et al., 2013; Haller and Bartsch, 2009] and advanced statistical techniques are needed to extract the signal of interest (representing for example the neuronal activity in a particular area) from the noise [Bowman et al., 2007; Bowman, 2014]. This thesis aims to contribute to this task, in particular to the subdiscipline of neuroscience that is concerned with networks of connected brain regions. I argue that brain connectivity studies frequently place too much con dence in neuroimaging techniques and fail to acknowledge the uncertainty associated with their estimated networks and analyses thereof. I investigate whether a Bayesian treatment of brain network …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C","num_citations":1,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=1451792377320673550","cites_id":["1451792377320673550"],"pub_url":"https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/170204/170204.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:DpHRqXnNJRQJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Opponent coding of sound location (azimuth) in planum temporale is robust to sound-level variations","pub_year":2016,"author":"Kiki Derey and Giancarlo Valente and Beatrice De Gelder and Elia Formisano","journal":"Cerebral Cortex","volume":"26","number":"1","pages":"450-464","publisher":"Oxford University Press","abstract":"Coding of sound location in auditory cortex (AC) is only partially understood. Recent electrophysiological research suggests that neurons in mammalian auditory cortex are characterized by broad spatial tuning and a preference for the contralateral hemifield, that is, a nonuniform sampling of sound azimuth.

To accommodate these findings, it has been proposed that sound location is encoded by the integrated activity of neuronal populations with opposite hemifield tuning (“opponent channel model”). In this study, we investigated the validity of such a model in human AC with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a phase-encoding paradigm employing binaural stimuli recorded individually for each participant.

In our proposed method, ConvNet prediction refinement was achieved by exploiting a fully connected CRF as a post-processing step. Our main contribution is focused on taking into account the scene dynamics in semantic image segmentation. For extracting these dynamics we used scene dense optical flow. Inference in this dynamic CRF will consider both scene appearance and dense optical flow information. We show that by utilizing temporal information, the accuracy of semantic image segmentation can be improved with a small incurring additional computational overhead.

We use distance-dependent Chinese restaurant processes (dd-CRPs) to define a flexible prior which partitions the voxel measurements into clusters whose number and shapes are unknown a priori. With dd-CRPs we can conveniently implement spatial constraints to ensure that our parcellations remain spatially contiguous and thereby physiologically meaningful. In the present work, we extend CAESAR by using Gaussian process (GP) priors to model the temporally smooth haemodynamic signals that give rise to the measured FMRI data. A challenge for GP inference in our setting is the cubic scaling with respect to the number of time points, which can become computationally prohibitive with FMRI measurements, potentially consisting of long time series. As a solution we describe an efficient implementation that is practically as fast as the corresponding time-independent non-GP model with typically-sized FMRI data sets. We also employ a population Monte-Carlo algorithm that can significantly speed up convergence compared to traditional single-chain methods. First we illustrate the benefits of CAESAR and the GP priors with simulated experiments. Next, we demonstrate our approach by parcellating resting state FMRI data measured from twenty participants as taken from the Human Connectome Project data repository.

Visual stimulation with pseudo-random bit-sequences evokes specific Broad-Band Visually Evoked Potentials (BBVEPs) that can be reliably used in BCI for high-speed communication in speller applications. In this study, we report a novel paradigm for a BBVEP-based BCI that utilizes a generative framework to predict responses to broad-band stimulation sequences. In this study we designed a BBVEP-based BCI using modulated Gold codes to mark cells in a visual speller BCI. We defined a linear generative model that decomposes full responses into overlapping single-flash responses. These single-flash responses are used to predict responses to novel stimulation sequences, which in turn serve as templates for classification. The linear generative model explains on average 50% and up to 66% of the variance of responses to both seen and unseen sequences. In an online experiment, 12 participants tested a 6 × 6 matrix speller BCI. On average, an online accuracy of 86% was reached with trial lengths of 3.21 seconds. This corresponds to an Information Transfer Rate of 48 bits per minute (approximately 9 symbols per minute). This study indicates the potential to model and predict responses to broad-band stimulation. These predicted responses are proven to be well-suited as templates for a BBVEP-based BCI, thereby enabling communication and control by brain activity only."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"eETiv1sAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC","num_citations":54,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=6450556420825625876","cites_id":["6450556420825625876"],"pub_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133797","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:FDXtYuP6hFkJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2014":1,"2015":0,"2016":2,"2017":6,"2018":6,"2019":9,"2020":10,"2021":13,"2022":7}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Spreading codes enables the blind estimation of the hemodynamic response with short-events sequences","pub_year":2015,"author":"Miguel Angel Lopez-Gordo and D Sanchez-Morillo and Marcel AJ Van Gerven","journal":"International Journal of Neural Systems","volume":"25","number":"01","pages":"1450035","publisher":"World Scientific Publishing Company","abstract":"Finite impulse response (FIR) filters are considered the least constrained option for the blind estimation of the hemodynamic response function (HRF).

Using empirical data, we show that the dynamic beamformer outperforms the standard beamformer in predicting the condition of interest which strongly suggests that it also outperforms the standard method in localizing the active neural generators."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=11980861724548351625","cites_id":["11980861724548351625"],"pub_url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34713-9_19","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:iUbH2kKSRKYJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2013":2,"2014":1,"2015":0,"2016":0,"2017":0,"2018":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Covert attention as a paradigm for subject-independent brain-computer interfacing","pub_year":2012,"author":"Hans JP Wouters and Marcel AJ Van Gerven and Matthias S Treder and Tom Heskes and Ali Bahramisharif","pages":"156-163","publisher":"Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg","abstract":"Humans can voluntarily deploy attention to locations in visual space without moving their eyes. It has been shown that the direction of this so-called ‘covert attention’ can be decoded on a single-trial basis from EEG and MEG data. In this paper we explore the possibility of using covert attention as a paradigm for subject-independent brain-computer interfacing (BCI). We find that although there is an average decrease of classification performance by moving to subject-independent learning, good subjects tend to remain good, indicating that performance of our BCI system depends on the subject individual performance level rather than whether or not the BCI system is trained using data of the same subject. This suggests that a calibration session can be omitted, which cuts down preparation time and thereby increases the practical relevance of covert attention based BCIs."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC","num_citations":1,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=14720952824885749153","cites_id":["14720952824885749153"],"pub_url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34713-9_20","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:oSWZaplUS8wJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2016":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Collection and Analysis of ground truth data for query intent","pub_year":2012,"author":"Maya Sappelli and Suzan Verberne and Maarten van der Heijden and Max Hinne and Wessel Kraaij","publisher":"[Sl: sn]","abstract":"Search engines try to support people in finding information and locating services on the web.

In this paper, we propose a local strategy for three frequently used centrality measures:(i) closeness,(ii) betweenness and (iii) PageRank. This local approach uses only the vertices directly adjacent to a target vertex to derive an approximation of the true centrality measure. The approximations are accompanied with an analysis of the approximation error bounds. Our analysis and experiments show that local approximations are quite successful on undirected graphs, and on directed graphs depending on the reciprocity of edges."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC","num_citations":5,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=5277985955293303270","cites_id":["5277985955293303270"],"pub_url":"https://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/769526/local_approximation_of_centrality_measures_-_max_hinne.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:5hHCKkMsP0kJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2013":1,"2014":0,"2015":1,"2016":0,"2017":1,"2018":0,"2019":1,"2020":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"DIR 2010: the tenth Dutch-Belgian information retrieval workshop","pub_year":2011,"author":"Wessel Kraaij and Suzan Verberne and Max Hinne and Maarten van der Heijden and Theo van der Weide","volume":"44","number":"2","pages":"64-66","publisher":"ACM","abstract":"The Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval workshop (DIR) is an annual event where the latest research results by Dutch and Belgian IR researchers are presented.

The aim of this paper is to describe the considerations that must be taken into account when constructing a DBN for complex medical domains and to demonstrate their usefulness in practice. To this end, we focus on the construction of a DBN for prognosis of carcinoid patients, compare performance with that of a proportional hazards model, and describe predictions for three individual patients.

It is based on a maximum (conditional) mutual information criterion. The algorithm is evaluated using a high-quality clinical dataset concerning disorders of the liver and biliary tract, showing a performance which exceeds that of state-of-the-art Bayesian classifiers. Furthermore, the algorithm places less restrictions on classifying Bayesian network structures and therefore allows easier clinical interpretation."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC","num_citations":5,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=10821870059609989813","cites_id":["10821870059609989813"],"pub_url":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30547-7_20","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:tSJ9hHsBL5YJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2004":1,"2005":0,"2006":0,"2007":1,"2008":1,"2009":0,"2010":1,"2011":0,"2012":0,"2013":0,"2014":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"How does the Library Searcher behave?","author":"Suzan Verberne and Max Hinne and Maarten van der Heijden and Eduard Hoenkamp and Wessel Kraaij and Theo van der Weide","journal":"A contrastive study of library search against ad-hoc search.[14]","volume":"99","abstract":"We investigated the search behaviour of the library searcher using the log data from The European Library (TEL). We were especially interested in how this behaviour compares to the search behaviour of ad-hoc searchers, represented by log data in the MSN search engine. At first sight, the two data sets mainly differ in the topics of the queries entered and their multi-lingual vs. mono-lingual content. When studying user behaviour, session information is very important: how does the user navigate through the engine’s interface? We visualized the TEL users’ interactions with the system by creating a transition network for the users’ intra-session actions. In general, we think that research into user behaviour on the basis of search engine logs can be very informative for the evaluation of search engine interfaces."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC","num_citations":3,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=14962872973409056038","cites_id":["14962872973409056038"],"pub_url":"https://www.academia.edu/download/75362950/2010_How_does_the_library_searcher_behave.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:JvVWT7HNps8J:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2009":1,"2010":0,"2011":2}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"This file was downloaded from: http://eprints. qut. edu. au/63640","author":"Suzan Verberne and Maarten van der Heijden and Max Hinne and Maya Sappelli","abstract":"The quality of a search engine critically depends on the ability to present results that are an adequate response to the user’s query and intent. Automatic intent recognition is a challenging problem because queries are often short or underspecified. In most intent recognition studies, annotations of query intent are created post-hoc by external assessors who are not the searchers themselves. It is important for the field to get a better understanding of the quality of this process as an approximation for determining the searcher’s actual intent. Query intent annotation quality has different aspects. Some annotation studies have investigated the reliability of the query intent annotation process by measuring the inter-assessor agreement. However, these studies did not measure the validity of the judgments, ie to what extent the annotations match the searcher’s actual intent. In this study, we asked both the searchers themselves and external assessors to classify queries using the same intent classification scheme. We show that of the seven dimensions in our intent classification scheme, four can reliably be used for query annotation. Of these four, only the annotations on the topic and spatial sensitivity dimension are valid when compared to the searcher’s annotations. The difference between the inter-assessor agreement and the assessor-searcher agreement was significant on all dimensions, showing that the agreement between external assessors is not a good estimator of the validity of the intent classifications. Therefore, we encourage the research community to consider using query intent classifications by the searchers themselves as ground truth."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.672.7257\u0026rep=rep1\u0026type=pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:d8OyqL-QsOAJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"The missing link: Predicting connectomes from noisy and partially observed tract tracing data-DTU Orbit (31/12/2018)","author":"Max Hinne"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14597649874338256768\u0026hl=en\u0026oi=scholarr","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Quantifying uncertainty in graph statistics","author":"RJ Janssen and M Hinne and T Heskes and MAJ van Gerven","journal":"Connecting the Dots","pages":"19","abstract":"The wiring diagram of the human brain can be described in terms of graph measures that characterize structural regularities. These measures require an estimate of whole-brain structural connectivity for which one may resort to deterministic or thresholded probabilistic streamlining procedures. While these procedures have provided important insights about the characteristics of human brain networks, they ultimately rely on unwarranted assumptions such as those of noise-free data or the use of an arbitrary threshold. Therefore, resulting structural connectivity estimates as well as derived graph measures fail to fully take into account the inherent uncertainty in the structural estimate. In this paper, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining posterior distributions over graph metrics using Bayesian inference. It is shown that this posterior distribution can be used to quantify uncertainty about graph-theoretical measures at the single subject level, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the graph-theoretical properties of human brain connectivity. We refer to this model-based approach to connectivity analysis as Bayesian connectomics."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:HeT0ZceujKMC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/183224/183224.pdf?sequence=1\u0026isAllowed=y#page=23","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:SnInUyPsNjkJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Knowledge Representation and Reasoning","author":"Marcel van Gerven and Arjen Hommersom and Wenyun Quan and Maarten van der Heijden and Max Hinne","abstract":"Knowledge Representation and Reasoning People involved Course outline Topics Page 1 \nKnowledge Representation and Reasoning Peter Lucas1 and Marcel van Gerven2 peterl@cs.ru.nl,m.vangerven@donders.ru.nl \n1Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, and 2Donders Centre for Cognition, \nRadboud University Nijmegen Knowledge Representationand Reasoning – p. 1/28 People \ninvolved Lectures: Peter Lucas Marcel van Gerven Arjen Hommersom Practicals and \ntutorials: Wenyun Quan (w.quan@cs.ru.nl) Maarten van der Heijden (m.vanderheijden@gmail.com) \nArjen Hommersom (arjenh@cs.ru.nl) Max Hinne (mhinne@cs.ru.nl) Start practical: See \nblackboard/website Knowledge Representationand Reasoning Course outline Website: http://www.cs.ru.nl/∼peterl/teaching/KeR \n(1) Lectures: Theory of knowledge representation and reasoning; core of this formed by: AI-style \nlogics and probability …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"http://cs.ru.nl/~peterl/teaching/KeR/intro4.ps.gz","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:mKbvx3eKrswJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Bayesian estimation of conditional independence graphs improves functional connectivity estimates Supporting Information S2","author":"Max Hinne and Ronald J Janssen and Tom Heskes1and Marcel AJ van Gerven","abstract":"For each distribution, three parallel chains were executed until convergence. Convergence was assessed by computing the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF)[Gelman and Rubin, 1992], which can be understood as a ratio between intra-chain variance and inter-chain variance. Heuristically, we assumed convergence for connectivity when for each edge (i, j) and each element kij the PSRF dropped below 1.1. For the first model, convergence was attained within 20,000 samples. The multimodal approach proved substantially slower to converge, requiring between 50,000 and 200,000 samples. Four subjects contained edges and elements in the precision matrix that did not fully converge within reasonable time. However, for these subjects the chains did reach convergence in terms of the network density of G and the matrix determinant of K, which motivated us to treat them the same as the other subjects. The last model with a more specific prior decreases the number of free parameters, which makes the convergence substantially faster; convergence was attained within 10,000 samples.The computation speed of a single sample is determined by an iteration over p (p-1)/2 elements and computing two Cholesky decompositions for each element, resulting in a total time complexity of O (p5). Although an efficient implementation in C++ using BLAS [Blackford et al., 2002] and LAPACK [Anderson et al., 1999] was used, the complexity of the algorithm makes the approach infeasible for use with a large number of variables. To demonstrate this, Fig 1 shows for different values of p the corresponding computation time of a single sample, using a single 2 …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"oEtR-fkAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8e3f/8b2f725151173f1414cf2300a97a9482f8a3.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs\u0026hl=en\u0026q=related:n62y26_eMFEJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/publications","query":{},"buildId":"0RUqPQ06vHyvCF_izsXlu","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
