increasingly complex stimulus features in downstream areas. We quantitatively show that there indeed exists an explicit gradient for feature complexity in the ventral pathway of the human brain. This was achieved by mapping thousands of stimulus features of increasing complexity across the cortical sheet using a deep neural network. Our approach also revealed a fine-grained functional specialization of downstream areas of the ventral stream. Furthermore, it allowed decoding of representations from human brain activity at an unsurpassed degree of accuracy, confirming the quality of the developed approach. Stimulus features that successfully explained neural responses indicate that population receptive fields were explicitly tuned for object categorization.

In this article we will review the critical steps of the BCI cycle, the present issues and state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we will develop a vision on how recently obtained results may contribute to new insights in neurocognition and, in particular, in the neural representation of perceived stimuli, intended actions and emotions.

Accordingly, perception has sometimes been cast as a process of inference, whereby sensory inputs are combined with prior knowledge. However, despite a wealth of behavioral literature supporting an account of perception as probabilistic inference, the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. One important question is whether top-down expectation biases stimulus representations in early sensory cortex, i.e., whether the integration of prior knowledge and bottom-up inputs is already observable at the earliest levels of sensory processing. Alternatively, early sensory processing may be unaffected by top-down expectations, and integration of prior knowledge and bottom-up input may take place in downstream association areas that are proposed to be involved in perceptual decision-making.

This is motivated by BCIs being applicable for helping disabled, for gaming, and as a tool in cognitive neuroscience. Often, motor imagery is used to produce (binary) control signals. However, finding other types of control signals that allow the discrimination of multiple classes would help to increase the applicability of BCIs. We have investigated if modulation of posterior alpha activity by means of covert spatial attention in two dimensions can be reliably classified in single trials.

We used Bayesian logistic regression with a multivariate Laplace prior for classification. Marked differences in classification performance were observed for the tested modalities. Highest accuracies (89% correctly classified trials) were attained when classifying object drawings. In auditory and orthographical modalities, results were lower though still significant for some subjects. The employed classification method allowed for a precise temporal localization of the features that contributed to the performance of the classifier for three modalities.

Furthermore, many paradigms use intense visual stimulation, which can be irritating especially in long BCI sessions. However, BCIs can more directly directly tap the neural processes underlying visual attention. Covert shifts of visual attention induce changes in oscillatory alpha activity in posterior cortex, even in the absence of visual stimulation. The aim was to investigate whether different pairs of directions of attention shifts can be reliably differentiated based on the electroencephalogram. To this end, healthy participants (N = 8) had to strictly fixate a central dot and covertly shift visual attention to one out of six cued directions. Covert attention shifts induced a prolonged alpha synchronization over posterior electrode sites (PO and O electrodes). Spectral changes had specific topographies so that different pairs of directions could be differentiated. There was substantial variation across participants with respect to the direction pairs that could be reliably classified. Mean accuracy for the best-classifiable pair amounted to 74.6%. Furthermore, an alpha power index obtained during a relaxation measurement showed to be predictive of peak BCI performance (r = .66). Results confirm posterior alpha power modulations as a viable input modality for gaze-independent EEG-based BCIs. The pair of directions yielding optimal performance varies across participants.

Here, we review recent neuroimaging studies comparing these two forms of visual experience. Their results suggest that there is a large overlap in neural processing during perception and imagery: neural representations of imagined and perceived stimuli are similar in the visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. Furthermore, perception and imagery seem to rely on similar top-down connectivity. The most prominent difference is the absence of bottom-up processing during imagery.

While technical developments obviously are important, we will here argue that new insight gained from cognitive neuroscience can be used to identify signatures of neural activation which reliably can be modulated by the subject at will. This review will focus mainly on oscillatory activity in the alpha band which is strongly modulated by changes in covert attention. Besides developing BCIs for their traditional purpose, they might also be used as a research tool for cognitive neuroscience. There is currently a strong interest in how brain state fluctuations impact cognition. These state fluctuations are partly reflected by ongoing oscillatory activity. The functional role of the brain state can be investigated by introducing stimuli in real time to subjects depending on the actual state of the brain. This principle of brain-state dependent stimulation may also be used as a practical tool for augmenting human behavior. In conclusion, new approaches based on online analysis of ongoing brain activity are currently in rapid development.

We show that by using the hierarchical generative model, we can obtain good-quality reconstructions of visual images of handwritten digits presented during an fMRI scanning session."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C","num_citations":60,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=17049832481793841973,10115686986996029220","cites_id":["17049832481793841973","10115686986996029220"],"pub_url":"https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article-abstract/22/12/3127/7597","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:JJfwLrgjYowJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2010":1,"2011":1,"2012":1,"2013":4,"2014":3,"2015":3,"2016":1,"2017":13,"2018":6,"2019":8,"2020":7,"2021":11,"2022":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Bayesian source localization with the multivariate Laplace prior","pub_year":2009,"author":"Marcel Gerven and Botond Cseke and Robert Oostenveld and Tom Heskes","journal":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","volume":"22","abstract":"We introduce a novel multivariate Laplace (MVL) distribution as a sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian source localization that allows the specification of constraints between and within sources.

During perception, visual activity is characterized by distinct processing stages, but the temporal dynamics underlying imagery remain unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of visual imagery in human participants using magnetoencephalography. Firstly, we show that, compared to perception, imagery decoding becomes significant later and representations at the start of imagery already overlap with later time points. This suggests that during imagery, the entire visual representation is activated at once or that there are large differences in the timing of imagery between trials. Secondly, we found consistent overlap between imagery and perceptual processing around 160 ms and from 300 ms after stimulus onset. This indicates that the N170 gets reactivated during imagery and that imagery does not rely on early perceptual representations. Together, these results provide important insights for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of visual imagery."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:sAujV351FBYC","num_citations":56,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=4387005179612001438","cites_id":["4387005179612001438"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/33904","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nnSSrvfF4TwJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":12,"2020":14,"2021":24,"2022":5},"mandates":[{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","acknowledgement":" …Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (678286) …"},{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","grant":"639.072. 513"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Computational foundations of natural intelligence","pub_year":2017,"author":"Marcel Van Gerven","pages":"112","publisher":"Frontiers","abstract":"New developments in AI and neuroscience are revitalizing the quest to understanding natural intelligence, offering insight about how to equip machines with human-like capabilities.

To overcome the challenge of formalizing what stimulus features should modulate single voxel responses, we introduce a general approach for making directly testable predictions of single voxel responses to statistically adapted representations of ecologically valid stimuli. These representations are learned from unlabeled data without supervision. Our approach is validated using a parsimonious computational model of (i) how early visual cortical representations are adapted to statistical regularities in natural images and (ii) how populations of these representations are pooled by single voxels. This computational model is used to predict single voxel responses to natural images and identify natural images from stimulus-evoked multiple voxel responses. We show that statistically adapted low-level sparse and invariant representations of natural images better span the space of early visual cortical representations and can be more effectively exploited in stimulus identification than hand-designed Gabor wavelets.

This motivates the idea that the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the connection profiles of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar connection profiles together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar connection profiles consist of regions that have previously been identified as the ‘rich club’; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments.

It is often hypothesised that a reversal in neural processing underlies the generation of mental images as abstract representations are used to construct sensory representations in the absence of sensory input. According to predictive processing theories, such reversed processing also plays a central role in later stages of perception. Direct experimental evidence of reversals in neural information flow has been missing. Here, we used a combination of machine learning and magnetoencephalography to characterise neural dynamics in humans. We provide direct evidence for a reversal of the perceptual feed-forward cascade during imagery and show that, during perception, such reversals alternate with feed-forward processing in an 11 Hz oscillatory pattern. Together, these results show how common feedback processes support both veridical perception and mental imagery."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:9qGwjJavaBUC","num_citations":25,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=9991129417608214260","cites_id":["9991129417608214260"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://elifesciences.org/articles/53588","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:9DZ-IUWfp4oJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":1,"2020":5,"2021":14,"2022":4},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research 639.072.51 …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Neural tuning to low-level features of speech throughout the perisylvian cortex","pub_year":2017,"author":"Julia Berezutskaya and Zachary V Freudenburg and Umut Güçlü and Marcel AJ van Gerven and Nick F Ramsey","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","volume":"37","number":"33","pages":"7906-7920","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","abstract":"Despite a large body of research, we continue to lack a detailed account of how auditory processing of continuous speech unfolds in the human brain.

We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training points.

This generalizes the popular quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling. In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally, our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture, the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the quantized softmax approach."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:lg5bARUibhcC","num_citations":23,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=10047485456764185500","cites_id":["10047485456764185500"],"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07111","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:nCtVAMrWb4sJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":5,"2020":4,"2021":8,"2022":4}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Modeling, recognizing, and explaining apparent personality from videos","pub_year":2020,"author":"Hugo Jair Escalante and Heysem Kaya and Albert Ali Salah and Sergio Escalera and Yağmur Güç and Umut Güçlü and Xavier Baró and Isabelle Guyon and Julio CS Jacques and Meysam Madadi and Stephane Ayache and Evelyne Viegas and Furkan Gurpinar and Achmadnoer Sukma Wicaksana and Cynthia Liem and Marcel AJ Van Gerven and Rob Van Lier","journal":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","publisher":"IEEE","abstract":"Explainability and interpretability are two critical aspects of decision support systems.

We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance.  Approach We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a covert orientation discrimination task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3.5°) or far (7°) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block.  Main Results Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1.85 s and 2.25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65.9%) than in the easy task condition (61.1%). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate.  Significance Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand.

This coupled activity is conveniently expressed using covariance, but this measure fails to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. A popular alternative that addresses this issue is partial correlation, which regresses out the signal of potentially confounding variables, resulting in a measure that reveals only direct connections. Importantly, provided the data are normally distributed, if two variables are conditionally independent given all other variables, their respective partial correlation is zero. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model that allows us to estimate functional connectivity in terms of both partial correlations and a graph representing conditional independencies. Simulation results show that this methodology is able to outperform the graphical LASSO, which is the de facto standard for estimating partial correlations. Furthermore, we apply the model to estimate functional connectivity for twenty subjects using resting-state fMRI data.

NIF models represent neural information processing via a network of coupled tensors, each encoding the representation of the sensory input contained in a brain region. The elements of these tensors can be interpreted as cortical columns whose activity encodes the presence of a specific feature in a spatiotemporal location. Each tensor is coupled to the measured data specific to a brain region via low-rank observation models that can be decomposed into the spatial, temporal and feature receptive fields of a localized neuronal population. Both these observation models and the convolutional weights defining the information processing within regions are learned end-to-end by predicting the neural signal during sensory stimulation.

Therefore, resulting structural connectivity estimates as well as derived graph measures fail to fully take into account the inherent uncertainty in the structural estimate.

These findings extend the decoding results for static gratings and are of importance in the decoding of ongoing changes in mental state."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C","num_citations":13,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=5211670357844276277","cites_id":["5211670357844276277"],"pub_url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911005088","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:NbS97ZOSU0gJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2011":1,"2012":1,"2013":2,"2014":2,"2015":2,"2016":0,"2017":2,"2018":2,"2019":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Gait-prop: A biologically plausible learning rule derived from backpropagation of error","pub_year":2020,"author":"Nasir Ahmad and Marcel A van Gerven and Luca Ambrogioni","journal":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems","volume":"33","pages":"10913-10923","abstract":"Traditional backpropagation of error, though a highly successful algorithm for learning in artificial neural network models, includes features which are biologically implausible for learning in real neural circuits. An alternative called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural network into layer-wise and plausible ‘targets’ for every unit. These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically, backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:4JjQL45tqTYC","num_citations":12,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=15875049954561764197","cites_id":["15875049954561764197"],"pub_url":"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/7ba0691b7777b6581397456412a41390-Abstract.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZSs89dKBT9wJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":2,"2021":8,"2022":2}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Classifying sex and strain from mouse ultrasonic vocalizations using deep learning","pub_year":2020,"author":"A Ivanenko and Paul Watkins and Marcel AJ van Gerven and K Hammerschmidt and Bernhard Englitz","journal":"PLoS computational biology","volume":"16","number":"6","pages":"e1007918","publisher":"Public Library of Science","abstract":"Vocalizations are widely used for communication between animals. Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts. During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information. Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs and using 24 extracted features per USV, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features. The same network architecture was also able to achieve above-chance classification for cortexless mice, which were considered indistinguishable before.

The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN’s decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field’s complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means “to explain” the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach’s “ability to explain”.

We hope the guide is seen as a starting point for those embarking on this research field."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:uDl620nrkPcC","num_citations":7,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=5823096581545580132","cites_id":["5823096581545580132"],"pub_url":"https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/13200","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ZNbQI33Lz1AJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":1,"2022":6}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Automatic structured variational inference","pub_year":2021,"author":"Luca Ambrogioni and Kate Lin and Emily Fertig and Sharad Vikram and Max Hinne and Dave Moore and Marcel van Gerven","conference":"International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics","pages":"676-684","publisher":"PMLR","abstract":"Stochastic variational inference offers an attractive option as a default method for differentiable probabilistic programming. However, the performance of the variational approach depends on the choice of an appropriate variational family. Here, we introduce automatic structured variational inference (ASVI), a fully automated method for constructing structured variational families, inspired by the closed-form update in conjugate Bayesian models. These pseudo-conjugate families incorporate the forward pass of the input probabilistic program and can therefore capture complex statistical dependencies. Pseudo-conjugate families have the same space and time complexity of the input probabilistic program and are therefore tractable for a very large family of models including both continuous and discrete variables. We validate our automatic variational method on a wide range of both low-and high-dimensional inference problems. We find that ASVI provides a clear improvement in performance when compared with other popular approaches such as mean field family and inverse autoregressive flows.

Despite this, with the exception of the C. elegans roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied ex vivo. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a ‘latent space model’ that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque, where we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two baselines and an alternative model in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex.

Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a nontrivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments, we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The results of these proof-of-principle experiments illustrate the potential of end-to-end optimization for prosthetic vision.

Here we use computational modelling to demonstrate that such architectural hard-wiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge asa consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimise their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organise into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections, and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input.

Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex). Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:ypg3kOuG8gIC","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=10977080310325828461","cites_id":["10977080310325828461"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007992","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:bdvnF2JsVpgJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2020":1,"2021":3,"2022":2},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …NWO Gravitation grant 024.001.006) …"},{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","grant":"Advanced iConnect Project Grant ADV 320708"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Between-subject variability in the influence of mental imagery on conscious perception","pub_year":2019,"author":"N Dijkstra and M Hinne and SE Bosch and MAJ van Gerven","journal":"Scientific reports","volume":"9","number":"1","pages":"1-10","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","abstract":"Mental imagery and visual perception rely on similar neural mechanisms, but the function of this overlap remains unclear.

In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, CNN representations of visual stimuli have previously been shown to correspond to processing stages in the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual system. Whether this correspondence between models and brain signals also holds for activity acquired at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feedforward sweep across the visual hierarchy between 75-200 ms after stimulus onset. This spatiotemporal cascade was captured by the network layer representations, where the increasingly abstract stimulus representation in the hierarchical network model was reflected in different parts of the visual cortex, following the visual ventral stream. We further validated the accuracy of our encoding model by decoding stimulus identity in a left-out validation set of viewed objects, achieving state-of-the-art decoding accuracy."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:vct99db0rDQC","num_citations":6,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=16230780599409657628","cites_id":["16230780599409657628"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/118091.abstract","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HEcd9_VQP-EJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2018":3,"2019":0,"2020":2,"2021":1},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …VIDI grant number 864.14.011 …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Regularizing solutions to the MEG inverse problem using space-time separable covariance functions","pub_year":2016,"author":"Arno Solin and Pasi Jylänki and Jaakko Kauramäki and Tom Heskes and Marcel AJ van Gerven and Simo Särkkä","journal":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.04931","abstract":"In magnetoencephalography (MEG) the conventional approach to source reconstruction is to solve the underdetermined inverse problem independently over time and space.

Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data. These programs can be constructed automatically from an input probabilistic program and can also be amortized automatically. We evaluate the performance of the new variational programs in a series of structured inference problems. We find that cascading flows have much higher performance than both normalizing flows and ASVI in a large set of structured inference problems."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:3utUx_xxzcoC","num_citations":4,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=16991650093300670925","cites_id":["16991650093300670925"],"pub_url":"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/ambrogioni21a.html","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:zWHr9rt3zusJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2021":4}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"A nested cortical hierarchy of neural states underlies event segmentation in the human brain","pub_year":2021,"author":"Linda Geerligs and Marcel van Gerven and Karen L Campbell and Umut Güçlü","journal":"bioRxiv","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","abstract":"A fundamental aspect of human experience is that it is segmented into discrete events.

Using an innovative data-driven state segmentation method, we investigate how neural states are organized across the cortical hierarchy and where in cortex neural state and perceived event boundaries overlap. Our results show that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions and long states in anterior temporal pole and lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Neural state boundaries overlap with event boundaries across large parts of this hierarchy. State boundaries are shared within and between groups of brain regions that resemble well known functional networks, such as the default mode network that fractionates into two subnetworks – one fast, one slow.

We propose a recurrent generative neural network model that predicts a visual scene based on foveated glimpses. The model shifts its attention in order to minimize the uncertainty in its predictions. We show that the proposed model produces naturalistic eye movements focusing on informative stimulus regions.

The pRF model is used for estimating retinotopy, defining functional localizers and to study a vast amount of cognitive tasks. In a classic pRF, the cartesian location and receptive field size are modeled as a 2D Gaussian kernel in visual space and are estimated by optimizing the fit between observed responses and predicted responses. In the standard framework this is achieved using an iterative gradient descent algorithm. This optimization is time consuming because the number of pRFs to fit (e.g., fMRI voxels) is typically large. This computation time increases further with the complexity of the pRF model (e.g., adding HRF parameters, surround suppression and uncertainty measures). Here, we introduce DeepRF, which uses deep convolutional neural networks to estimate pRFs. We compare the performance of DeepRF with that of the conventional method using a synthetic dataset for which the ground truth is known and an empirical dataset. We show that DeepRF achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than the conventional method.

In our proposed method, ConvNet prediction refinement was achieved by exploiting a fully connected CRF as a post-processing step. Our main contribution is focused on taking into account the scene dynamics in semantic image segmentation. For extracting these dynamics we used scene dense optical flow. Inference in this dynamic CRF will consider both scene appearance and dense optical flow information. We show that by utilizing temporal information, the accuracy of semantic image segmentation can be improved with a small incurring additional computational overhead.

Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts, for instance courtship, territorial dispute, dominance and mother-pup interaction. Previous studies have pointed to differences in the USVs in different context, sexes, strains and individuals, however, in many cases the outcomes of the analyses remained inconclusive.We here provide a more general approach to automatically classify USVs using deep neural networks (DNN). We classified the sex of the emitting mouse (C57Bl/6) based on the vocalization’s spectrogram, reaching unprecedented performance (~84% correct) in comparison with other techniques (Support Vector Machines: 64%, Ridge regression: 52%). Vocalization characteristics of individual mice only contribute mildly, and sex-only classification reaches ~78%. The performance can only partially be explained by a set of classical shape features, with duration, volume and bandwidth being the most useful predictors. Splitting estimation into two DNNs, from spectrograms to features (57-82%) and features to sex (67%) does not reach the single-step performance.In summary, the emitter’s sex can be successfully predicted from their spectrograms using DNNs, excelling over other classification techniques. In contrast to previous research, this suggests that male and female vocalizations differ in their spectrotemporal structure, recognizable even in single vocalizations."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:KFIQUvoPKFAC","num_citations":3,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=1977860050484646715","cites_id":["1977860050484646715"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/358143.abstract","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:O9OSnDzFchsJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":2,"2020":0,"2021":1},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …NWO …"},{"agency":"European Commission","url_policy":"https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/ERC%20Open%20Access%20guidelines-Version%201.1._10.04.2017.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/horizon2020_eu-2021-02-13-en.pdf","effective_date":"2013/12","embargo":"6 months","acknowledgement":" …Marie-Sklodowska Curie grant (# 660328) …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Modeling brain responses to perceived speech with lstm networks","pub_year":2017,"author":"Julia Berezutskaya and Z Freudenburg and N Ramsey and U Güçlü and M van Gerven and W Duivesteijn and M Pechenizkiy and G Fletcher and V Menkovski and E Postma","journal":"Benelearn","pages":"149-153","abstract":"We used recurrent neural networks with longshort term memory units (LSTM) to model the brain responses to speech based on the speech audio features.

In this paper, we introduce a principled method for training an ensemble of GANs using semi-discrete optimal transport theory. In our approach, each generative network models the transportation map between a point mass (Dirac measure) and the restriction of the data distribution on a tile of a Voronoi tessellation that is defined by the location of the point masses.

A Bayesian hierarchical model was used, allowing us to simultaneously study group-level effects as well as effects for individual participants. We found strong effects of both imagery as well as its interaction with sensory evidence within individual participants.

Although an artificially generated prosthetic percept is relatively limited compared with normal vision, it may provide some elementary perception of the surroundings, re-enabling daily living functionality. For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection. A simulated electrode resolution of 26× 26 was found to provide sufficient information for mobility in a simple environment.

We use distance-dependent Chinese restaurant processes (dd-CRPs) to define a flexible prior which partitions the voxel measurements into clusters whose number and shapes are unknown a priori. With dd-CRPs we can conveniently implement spatial constraints to ensure that our parcellations remain spatially contiguous and thereby physiologically meaningful. In the present work, we extend CAESAR by using Gaussian process (GP) priors to model the temporally smooth haemodynamic signals that give rise to the measured FMRI data. A challenge for GP inference in our setting is the cubic scaling with respect to the number of time points, which can become computationally prohibitive with FMRI measurements, potentially consisting of long time series. As a solution we describe an efficient implementation that is practically as fast as the corresponding time-independent non-GP model with typically-sized FMRI data sets. We also employ a population Monte-Carlo algorithm that can significantly speed up convergence compared to traditional single-chain methods. First we illustrate the benefits of CAESAR and the GP priors with simulated experiments. Next, we demonstrate our approach by parcellating resting state FMRI data measured from twenty participants as taken from the Human Connectome Project data repository. Results show that CAESAR affords highly robust and scalable whole-brain clustering of FMRI timecourses."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:8RJSsxxtMAkC","num_citations":1,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=6232885092186405881","cites_id":["6232885092186405881"],"public_access":true,"pub_url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164703","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-TuZ1fenf1YJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2017":1},"mandates":[{"agency":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","url_policy":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","url_policy_cached":"/mandates/nwo_nl-2018-01-28-en.pdf","effective_date":"2015/12","embargo":"none","acknowledgement":" …grant numbers 612.001.211and 639.072.513of The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO …"}]},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Improving semantic video segmentation by dynamic scene integration","pub_year":2016,"author":"F Ghazvinian Zanjani and M van Gerven","abstract":"Improving semantic video segmentation by dynamic scene integration (2016) | www.narcis.nl \nKNAW KNAW Narcis Back to search results Eindhoven University of Technology \nPublication Improving semantic video segmentation by dynamic scene integration (2016) \nPagina-navigatie: Main Save publication Save as MODS Export to Mendeley Save as \nEndNote Export to RefWorks Title Improving semantic video segmentation by dynamic \nscene integration Author Ghazvinian Zanjani, F.; van Gerven, M.; de With, PHN Publisher \nVideo Coding & Architectures; Signal Processing Systems Date issued 2016 Access \nRestricted Access Language English Type Conference Paper Publication https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/b8bbc70e-fa1c-4193-9... \nOpenURL Search this publication in (your) library Persistent Identifier urn:nbn:nl:ui:25-b8bbc70e-fa1c-4193-927e-1538a11d177f \nMetadata XML Source Eindhoven University of …"},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:Yj1HztTP_LkC","num_citations":1,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=15333236143740167627","cites_id":["15333236143740167627"],"pub_url":"https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:pure.tue.nl:publications%2Fb8bbc70e-fa1c-4193-927e-1538a11d177f","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:yyXQpAiZytQJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2019":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Apparent Personality Trait Prediction with Audiovisual Deep Residual Networks","pub_year":2016,"author":"Yağmur Güçlütürk and Marc Pérez and Umut Güçlü and Xavier Baró and Baiyu Chen and Hugo Jair Escalante and Isabelle Guyon and Carlos Andujar and Rob van Lier and Marcel AJ van Gerven and Julio Jacques Junior and Sergio Escalera","abstract":"• We present a system that can mimic the way people form first impressions about the Big-Five personality traits of unfamiliar individuals.• Big-Five personality traits are: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.• The predictions that our system makes do not necessarily reflect the true personality traits of the individual, but the apparent personality traits.• The system rather provides an opportunity for individuals to learn about what other people would think of them after a very brief interaction."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:_8B_re9sV0EC","num_citations":1,"citedby_url":"/scholar?cites=1523087370221512874","cites_id":["1523087370221512874"],"pub_url":"https://sergioescalera.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NIPSDemoTrait.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:qujvv-QXIxUJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{"2017":1}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Hidden Markov models for reading words from the human brain","pub_year":2015,"author":"Sanne Schoenmakers and Tom Heskes and Marcel Van Gerven","conference":"2015 International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging","pages":"89-92","publisher":"IEEE","abstract":"Recent work has shown that it is possible to reconstruct perceived stimuli from human brain activity.

Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a nontrivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments, we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The results of these proof-of-principle experiments illustrate the potential of end-to-end optimization for prosthetic vision.

For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection.

In contrast, the human brain is able to efficiently learn effective control strategies using limited resources. This raises the question whether insights from neuroscience can be used to improve current RL methods. Predictive processing is a popular theoretical framework which maintains that the human brain is actively seeking to minimize surprise. We show that recurrent neural networks which predict their own sensory states can be leveraged to minimise surprise, yielding substantial gains in cumulative reward. Specifically, we present the Predictive Processing Proximal Policy Optimization (P4O) agent; an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that applies predictive processing to a recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm by integrating a world model in its hidden state. P4O significantly outperforms a baseline recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm on multiple Atari games using a single GPU. It also outperforms other state-of-the-art agents given the same wall-clock time and exceeds human gamer performance on Seaquest, which is a particularly challenging environment in the Atari domain.

This method constructs local, layer-wise weight update targets in order to enable plausible credit assignment.

In fact, when background is explicitly added to the input, a decrease in performance was measured across all models."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:MKvDIwB-zewC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09831","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:cixI_ipzzXEJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"Temporal factorization of 3D convolutional kernels","pub_year":2019,"author":"Gabriëlle Ras and Luca Ambrogioni and Umut Güçlü and Marcel AJ van Gerven","journal":"arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.04075","abstract":"3D convolutional neural networks are difficult to train because they are parameter-expensive and data-hungry.

A Bayesian hierarchical model was used, allowing us to simultaneously study group-level effects as well as effects for individual participants. We found strong effects of both imagery as well as its interaction with sensory evidence within individual participants.

Therefore, it remains unclear how much of an influence eye movements can have on observed effects in MEG. We find that we can decode stimulus location from eye movements in two different stages of a working memory match-to-sample task that encompass different areas of research typically done with MEG.

Concretely, we show that if the data can be described in terms of N finite sets and the used activation function f is non-constant, increasing and has a left asymptote, we can derive how many nodes are needed to linearly separate these sets. This will be an upper bound that depends on the structure of the data. This structure can be analyzed using an algorithm.

When studying the cognitive capabilities of the brain, scientists follow a system identification approach in which they present different stimuli to the subjects and try to model the response that different brain areas have of that stimulus. The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning. In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:D8wXzuvKacYC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01437","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"fMRI measurements of visual imagery and perception of different categories.","pub_year":2017,"author":"N Dijkstra and SE Bosch and MAJ van Gerven","publisher":"Radboud Data Repository","abstract":"The data were collected while participants performed a retro-cue working memory type of task.

It remains unclear whether competition is resolved already at the early stages of visual processing and that information about the dominant percept is then fed forward to more higher-level areas or whether competition is first resolved in high-level areas and then fed back to lower-levels. This study aimed to dissociate between these ideas by investigating the direction of information prior to a perceptual switch, using Granger causality on classifier output from temporal and occipital ROIs. The results point towards increased top-down information flow between temporal and occipital areas before a switch in dominance.

Data from two sets of ten participants were used to obtain parcellations and examine their robustness. This stable clustering was used to initialize a more constrained model in order to obtain individualized parcellations in 57 additional participants. Resulting cluster time courses were used to examine functional connectivity between clusters and related to the rest of the brain in a GLM analysis.We find six distinct clusters in each hemisphere, with clear interhemispheric correspondence and functional relevance. These clusters exhibit functional connectivity profiles that further underscore their homologous nature and are consistent with existing notions on segregation and integration in parallel cortico-basal ganglia loops.

We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance.Approach: We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a covert orientation discrimination task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3.5 u) or far (7u) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block.Main Results: Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1.85 s and 2.25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65.9%) than in the easy task condition (61.1%). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate.Significance: Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand.

Evidence from rodent electrophysiology studies suggests that the hippocampus plays a central role in coordinating the reactivation of neocortical memory representations during post-encoding offline periods. However, evidence from human neuroimaging studies is scarce and it remains unclear at which timescales offline memory reactivation occurs. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate changes in the resting-state brain connectivity pattern following a sequence learning task. Participants were required to remember several multi-item sequences, comprising alternating face and scene or faceless body stimuli. Preliminarily results suggest learning-induced changes in fMRI and source space MEG resting-state connectivity when comparing post-encoding rest with preexperimental baseline periods. Specifically, we observe increased correlation between the hippocampus and specialized ventral visual regions processing the categorical sequence stimuli.  Moreover, the stimulus-specific connectivity pattern across regions during encoding appears to show increased similarity to the connectivity pattern observed during post-encoding relative to the baseline rest period.

These measures require an estimate of whole-brain structural connectivity for which one may resort to deterministic or thresholded probabilistic streamlining procedures. While these procedures have provided important insights about the characteristics of human brain networks, they ultimately rely on unwarranted assumptions such as those of noise-free data or the use of an arbitrary threshold. Therefore, resulting structural connectivity estimates as well as derived graph measures fail to fully take into account the inherent uncertainty in the structural estimate. In this paper, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining posterior distributions over graph metrics using Bayesian inference. It is shown that this posterior distribution can be used to quantify uncertainty about graph-theoretical measures at the single subject level, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the graph-theoretical properties of human brain connectivity.

With this development to ever-deeper architectures it raises the question why the brain has not developed such architecture. Besides wiring constraints we argue that the brain operates under different circumstances when performing object recognition, being confronted with noisy and ambiguous sensory input. The role of time in the process of object recognition is investigated, showing that a recurrent neural network is able to integrate evidence about an object’s identity over time. When trained with reinforcement learning the agent is able to learn the amount of time needed to come to an accurate estimate of the stimulus.

It is unclear whether the host immune system has a direct influence on parasite gene expression. The parasite is known to secrete proteins that are thought to manipulate the host immune system. An open question is whether the malaria parasite regulates these proteins in response to immune system pressure. A recent study of Daily et al.[2] shows that in vivo parasite gene expression from 35 patients can be classified into three clusters. Besides expression data, Daily et al. collected sixteen patient characteristics, some of which are significantly different between the clusters (rank order test).We take an integrated probabilistic approach by predicting the malaria parasite cluster based on patient characteristics and their interactions. As the number of predictors (136) is larger than the number of patients, we use L1-regularized multinomial logistic regression. We find that the interaction of immune signaling molecules TNFα and TGFα explain cluster membership best, consistent with the notion that parasite gene expression reacts to immune system pressure."},"filled":true,"author_pub_id":"sX0ZypwAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC","num_citations":0,"pub_url":"http://adrianabirlutiu.uab.ro/pubs/conf/2010malaria.pdf","url_related_articles":"/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dS8kiAVJScoJ:scholar.google.com/","cites_per_year":{}},{"container_type":"Publication","source":"AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY","bib":{"title":"CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES FOR BCI","author":"A Bahramisharif and M van Gerven and O Jensen and T Heskes","abstract":"Brain computer interfacing (BCI) is a general term that is used for a direct connection between the brain and a computer [1].
