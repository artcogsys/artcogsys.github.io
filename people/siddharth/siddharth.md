Hello & welcome!
I am a Mechanical and Electrical engineer. Regarding my PhD, I am interested in, working on and learning about modelling and controlling mechanisms of natural intelligence in artificial adaptive agents using dynamical systems theory. My project touches upon subjects such as optimal foraging, allostasis, dynamical systems, reinforcement learning, evolution, information theory, active inference, cognitive neuroscience, communication in Multi-Agent systems, and origins of life, among many others. I am also passionate about Robotics, IOT and embedded systems.
