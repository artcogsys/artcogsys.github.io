I am a physician, working partially in the Human Genetics department of the Radboudumc and partially in this lab. As part of my PhD, I am working on applying artificial intelligence in our clinical practice. I hope to improve clinical care for our patients and make the life of doctors easier this way. I will mostly be working on facial recognition and using machine learning and probabilistic programming on phenotypic data, to help assist in diagnosing patients and see if we can predict the outcome of genetic tests.
