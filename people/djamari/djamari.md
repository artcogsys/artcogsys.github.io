My research focuses on the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the segmentation of information into meaningful events. Do the boundaries between segments reflect a change in representation of the external environment? Do these boundaries occur in a nested temporal hierarchy? Does attention affect the segments and in turn memory performance? To answer these questions, I am looking at fMRI and MEG data that are gathered while participants perceive real-life-like stimuli, and using a data-driven method to establish the segmentations.
