Restoring some visual perception in blindness, using intelligent technology? Thanks to current developments in neuro-technology and artificial intelligence, this is becoming a very realistic scenario! My research aims to optimise prosthetic vision by developing clever models that can capture our rather complex visual environment into meaningful stimulation patterns, bridging the gap between human and computer vision.
