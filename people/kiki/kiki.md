In my research, I investigate the computational mechanisms underlying neural encoding of sound location in naturalistic spatial hearing in normal and hearing-impaired listeners. To achieve this, I use an interdisciplinary approach combining cognitive neuroscience and computational modeling: I develop neurobiological-inspired deep neural network models of processing of sound location in subcortical auditory structures and the auditory cortex. Building on the resulting insights, I aim to optimize signal processing algorithms in cochlear implants to boost neural spatial auditory processing in cochlear implant users.
