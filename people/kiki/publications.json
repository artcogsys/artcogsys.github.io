            "abstract": "Coding of sound location in auditory cortex (AC) is only partially understood. Recent electrophysiological research suggests that neurons in mammalian auditory cortex are characterized by broad spatial tuning and a preference for the contralateral hemifield, that is, a nonuniform sampling of sound azimuth. Additionally, spatial selectivity decreases with increasing sound intensity. To accommodate these findings, it has been proposed that sound location is encoded by the integrated activity of neuronal populations with opposite hemifield tuning (“opponent channel model”). In this study, we investigated the validity of such a model in human AC with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a phase-encoding paradigm employing binaural stimuli recorded individually for each participant. In all subjects, we observed preferential fMRI responses to contralateral azimuth positions. Additionally, in most AC …"

However, neural encoding of sound location is a complex process involving the computation and integration of multiple spatial cues that are not represented directly in the sensory organ (the cochlea). Our understanding of these mechanisms has increased enormously in the past few years. Current research is focused on the contribution of animal models for understanding human spatial audition, the effects of behavioural demands on neural sound location encoding, the emergence of a cue-independent location representation in the auditory cortex, and the relationship between single-source and concurrent location encoding in complex auditory scenes. Furthermore, computational modelling seeks to unravel how neural representations of sound source locations are derived from the complex binaural waveforms of real …"

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed how active behavior affects encoding of sound location (azimuth) in primary auditory cortical areas and planum temporale (PT). According to the hierarchical model of auditory processing and cortical functional specialization, PT is implicated in sound location (“where”) processing. Yet, our results show that spatial tuning profiles in primary auditory cortical areas (left primary core and right caudo-medial belt) sharpened during a sound localization (“where”) task compared with a sound identification (“what”) task. In contrast, spatial tuning in PT was sharp but did not vary with task performance. We further applied a population pattern decoder to the measured fMRI activity …"

Results showed a small but significant effect of behavioral relevance: localization acuity was higher for complex sounds with a high level of behavioral relevance at several target locations.

Our results show that functional activation in response to sounds in general—independent of sound location—was stronger in the occipital cortex but reduced in the medial temporal cortex of blind participants in comparison with sighted participants. Additionally, activation patterns for binaural spatial processing were different for sighted and blind participants in planum temporale. Finally, fMRI responses in the auditory cortex of blind individuals carried less information on sound azimuth position than those in sighted individuals …"

The ELEPHANT study presents an alternative clinical trial design with a daily randomized approach evaluating individualized tonotopical fitting of a cochlear implant (CI). A single-blinded, daily-randomized clinical trial will be implemented to evaluate a new imaging-based CI mapping strategy. A minimum of 20 participants will be included from the start of the rehabilitation process with a 1-year follow-up period. Based on a post-operative cone beam CT scan (CBCT), mapping of electrical input will be aligned to natural place-pitch arrangement in the individual cochlea. The CI’s frequency allocation table will be adjusted to match the electrical stimulation of frequencies as closely as possible to corresponding acoustic locations in the cochlea. A randomization scheme will be implemented whereby the participant, blinded to the intervention allocation, crosses over between the experimental and standard fitting program on a daily basis, and thus effectively acts as his own control, followed by a period of free choice between both maps to incorporate patient preference. With this new approach the occurrence of a first-order carryover effect and a limited sample size is addressed. The experimental fitting strategy is thought to give rise to a steeper learning curve, result in better performance in challenging listening situations, improve sound quality, better complement residual acoustic hearing in the contralateral ear and be preferred by recipients of a CI. Concurrently, the suitability of the novel trial design will be considered in investigating …"

This paper introduces a deep learning approach to address these neurocomputational mechanisms: We develop a biological-inspired deep neural network model of sound azimuth encoding operating on auditory nerve representations of real-life sounds. We explore two types of loss functions: Euclidean distance and angular distance. Our results show that a network resembling the early stages of the human auditory pathway can predict sound azimuth location. The type of loss function modulates spatial acuity in different ways. Finally, learning is independent of environment-specific acoustic properties."

This study explores an alternative theory based on the hypothesis that under naturalistic conditions where affective signals are acted upon that rather than reflected upon, major emotion signals (face, body, voice) have sensory specific brain representations. During fMRI recordings, participants were presented naturalistic dynamic stimuli of emotions expressed in videos of either the face or the whole body, or voice fragments. To focus on automatic emotion processing and bypass explicit emotion cognition relying on conceptual processes, participants performed an unrelated target detection task presented in a different modality than the stimulus. Using multivariate analysis to asses neural activity patterns in response to emotion expressions in the different stimuli types, we show a distributed brain organization of affective signals in which distinct emotion signals are closely tied to the sensory origin. Our findings are consistent with the notion that under ecological conditions the various sensory emotion expressions have different functional roles, even when from an abstract conceptual vantage point they all exemplify the same emotion category."

After training, we visualize and quantify feature representations in intermediate layers to gain insights into the representational mechanisms underlying sound location encoding in CNNs.
