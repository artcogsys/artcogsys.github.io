            "abstract": "Humans and other animals use spatial hearing to rapidly localize events in the environment. However, neural encoding of sound location is a complex process involving the computation and integration of multiple spatial cues that are not represented directly in the sensory organ (the cochlea). Our understanding of these mechanisms has increased enormously in the past few years. Current research is focused on the contribution of animal models for understanding human spatial audition, the effects of behavioural demands on neural sound location encoding, the emergence of a cue-independent location representation in the auditory cortex, and the relationship between single-source and concurrent location encoding in complex auditory scenes. Furthermore, computational modelling seeks to unravel how neural representations of sound source locations are derived from the complex binaural waveforms of real …"

Recent electrophysiological research suggests that neurons in mammalian auditory cortex are characterized by broad spatial tuning and a preference for the contralateral hemifield, that is, a nonuniform sampling of sound azimuth. Additionally, spatial selectivity decreases with increasing sound intensity. To accommodate these findings, it has been proposed that sound location is encoded by the integrated activity of neuronal populations with opposite hemifield tuning (“opponent channel model”). In this study, we investigated the validity of such a model in human AC with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a phase-encoding paradigm employing binaural stimuli recorded individually for each participant. In all subjects, we observed preferential fMRI responses to contralateral azimuth positions. Additionally, in most AC …"

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed how active behavior affects encoding of sound location (azimuth) in primary auditory cortical areas and planum temporale (PT). According to the hierarchical model of auditory processing and cortical functional specialization, PT is implicated in sound location (“where”) processing. Yet, our results show that spatial tuning profiles in primary auditory cortical areas (left primary core and right caudo-medial belt) sharpened during a sound localization (“where”) task compared with a sound identification (“what”) task. In contrast, spatial tuning in PT was sharp but did not vary with task performance. We further applied a population pattern decoder to the measured fMRI activity …"

Results showed a small but significant effect of behavioral relevance: localization acuity was higher for complex sounds with a high level of behavioral relevance at several target locations.

The ELEPHANT study presents an alternative clinical trial design with a daily randomized approach evaluating individualized tonotopical fitting of a cochlear implant (CI). A single-blinded, daily-randomized clinical trial will be implemented to evaluate a new imaging-based CI mapping strategy. A minimum of 20 participants will be included from the start of the rehabilitation process with a 1-year follow-up period. Based on a post-operative cone beam CT scan (CBCT), mapping of electrical input will be aligned to natural place-pitch arrangement in the individual cochlea. The CI’s frequency allocation table will be adjusted to match the electrical stimulation of frequencies as closely as possible to corresponding acoustic locations in the cochlea. A randomization scheme will be implemented whereby the participant, blinded to the intervention allocation, crosses over between the experimental and standard fitting program on a daily basis, and thus effectively acts as his own control, followed by a period of free choice between both maps to incorporate patient preference. With this new approach the occurrence of a first-order carryover effect and a limited sample size is addressed. The experimental fitting strategy is thought to give rise to a steeper learning curve, result in better performance in challenging listening situations, improve sound quality, better complement residual acoustic hearing in the contralateral ear and be preferred by recipients of a CI. Concurrently, the suitability of the novel trial design will be considered in investigating …"

We explore two types of loss functions: Euclidean distance and angular distance. Our results show that a network resembling the early stages of the human auditory pathway can predict sound azimuth location. The type of loss function modulates spatial acuity in different ways. Finally, learning is independent of environment-specific acoustic properties."

This study explores an alternative theory based on the hypothesis that under naturalistic conditions where affective signals are acted upon that rather than reflected upon, major emotion signals (face, body, voice) have sensory specific brain representations. During fMRI recordings, participants were presented naturalistic dynamic stimuli of emotions expressed in videos of either the face or the whole body, or voice fragments. To focus on automatic emotion processing and bypass explicit emotion cognition relying on conceptual processes, participants performed an unrelated target detection task presented in a different modality than the stimulus. Using multivariate analysis to asses neural activity patterns in response to emotion expressions in the different stimuli types, we show a distributed brain organization of affective signals in which distinct emotion signals are closely tied to the sensory origin. Our findings are consistent with the notion that under ecological conditions the various sensory emotion expressions have different functional roles, even when from an abstract conceptual vantage point they all exemplify the same emotion category."

We found that spatial separation between talkers caused a preferential encoding of the contralateral speech in Heschl’s gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT), and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Location and spectrotemporal features were encoded in different aspects of the neural response. Specifically, the talker’s location changed the mean response level, whereas the talker’s spectrotemporal features altered the variation of response around response's baseline.

            "abstract": "Accurate sound localization in a reverberation environment is essential for human auditory perception. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been utilized to model the binaural human auditory pathway. However, CNN shows barriers in capturing the global acoustic features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Binaural Audio Spectrogram Transformer (BAST) model to predict the sound azimuth in both anechoic and reverberation environments. Two modes of implementation, i.e. BAST-SP and BAST-NSP corresponding to BAST model with shared and non-shared parameters respectively, are explored. Our model with subtraction interaural integration and hybrid loss achieves an angular distance of 1.29 degrees and a Mean Square Error of 1e-3 at all azimuths, significantly surpassing CNN based model. The exploratory analysis of the BAST's performance on the left-right hemifields and anechoic and reverberation environments shows its generalization ability as well as the feasibility of binaural Transformers in sound localization. Furthermore, the analysis of the attention maps is provided to give additional insights on the interpretation of the localization process in a natural reverberant environment."
