I am deeply curious about the natural aspects of computation and intelligence. My background is in Biotechnology and Neuroscience. I work under the supervision of Sander Keemink, and my research concerns the development of bio-plausible (spiking) neural network models. Specifically, I am interested in the brain's ability to generate controlled dynamic behavior through the use of lower-dimensional manifolds. My aim is to create more efficient and effective artificial learning agents, advancing the capabilities of AI systems and furthering our understanding of brain computations.
