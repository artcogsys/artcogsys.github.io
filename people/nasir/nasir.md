My research interests relate to spiking and recurrent neural networks and taking inspiration from these models for neuroscientific insights and better ML methods. In particular, thinking about the encoding of information in spike timing, the utility of firing rate trajectories, and more. Beyond this, I'm interested in functional/computational benefits that emerge in systems which are constrained as biology is (e.g. in energy, physical resources etc).
