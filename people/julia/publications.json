            "abstract": "Despite a large body of research, we continue to lack a detailed account of how auditory processing of continuous speech unfolds in the human brain. Previous research showed the propagation of low-level acoustic features of speech from posterior superior temporal gyrus toward anterior superior temporal gyrus in the human brain (Hullett et al., 2016). In this study, we investigate what happens to these neural representations past the superior temporal gyrus and how they engage higher-level language processing areas such as inferior frontal gyrus. We used low-level sound features to model neural responses to speech outside of the primary auditory cortex. Two complementary imaging techniques were used with human participants (both males and females): electrocorticography (ECoG) and fMRI. Both imaging techniques showed tuning of the perisylvian cortex to low-level speech features. With ECoG, we found …"

            "abstract": "Understanding how the human brain processes auditory input remains a challenge. Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex). Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception."

In this study, we investigated high‐density intracranial responses to speech fragments of a feature film, aiming to determine whether dPCC is engaged in perception of continuous speech. Our findings show that dPCC exhibited preference to speech over other tested sounds. Moreover, the identified area was involved in tracking of speech auditory properties including speech spectral envelope, its rhythmic phrasal pattern and pitch contour. DPCC also showed the ability to filter out noise from the perceived speech. Comparing these results to data from motor experiments showed that the …"

We tested whether these representations were useful in studying the human brain data. To this end, we collected electrocorticography responses to a short movie from 37 subjects and fitted their cortical patterns across multiple regions using the semantic components extracted from film frames.

The resulting forward amortized variational inference is a likelihood-free method as its gradient can be sampled without bias and without requiring any evaluation of either the model joint distribution or its derivatives. We prove that our new variational loss is optimized by the exact posterior marginals in the fully factorized mean-field approximation, a property that is not shared with the more conventional reverse KL inference. Furthermore, we show that forward amortized inference can be easily marginalized over large families of latent variables in order to obtain a marginalized variational posterior. We consider two examples of variational marginalization. In our first example we train a Bayesian forecaster for predicting a simplified chaotic model of atmospheric convection. In the second example we train an amortized variational approximation of a Bayesian optimal classifier by marginalizing over the model space. The result is a powerful meta-classification network that can solve arbitrary classification problems without further training."

Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) constitute such a population.

Making such data publicly available not only helps tackle reproducibility issues in science, it helps make more use of these valuable data. This is especially true for data collected using naturalistic tasks. Here, we describe a dataset collected from a large group of human subjects while they watched a short audiovisual film. The dataset has several unique features. First, it includes a large amount of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data (51 participants, age range of 5–55 years, who all performed the same task). Second, it includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings (30 participants, age range of 7–47) during the same task. Eighteen participants performed both iEEG and fMRI versions of the task, non-simultaneously. Third, the data were acquired using a rich audiovisual stimulus, for which …"

We aim to use a combination of data exploration approaches and data-driven feature extraction models to provide a more bottom-up way of studying the neural responses. We hope that these data-driven strategies can confirm some of the previous theory-based neurolinguistic findings but at the same time offer new insight regarding how the human brain processes speech related information."

One recent piece of evidence is provided by Wang et al.(2011) who have found greater activation for artificial versus real Chinese characters in the part of fusiform gyrus which usually manifests a greater response to words than to other types of visual stimuli (thus often considered as visual word form area, VWFA) and attributed their result to the one-back task performed by participants during the scan. We have observed similar inverse pattern of activation when contrasting familiar nouns with stimuli in unfamiliar script in readers of Russian who also performed one-back task. In 2 runs of a block-designed fMRI experiment 14 native speakers of Russian, none of whom were able to read Armenian or Chinese, viewed 25-second series of 6-character strings presented one-by-one …"
