I hold a background in control theory and engineering, with a passion for exploring the intricate realms of network control systems, nonlinear control systems, and reinforcement learning. My current focus lies at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and neuroscience. My work involves harnessing the principles of control theory to regulate brain dynamics, aimed at paving the way for more predictable and effective treatments for neurological disorders. Additionally, I'm driven to glean insights from the complexities of the human brain, inspiring the development of reinforcement learning strategies that embody a more natural form of intelligence.
