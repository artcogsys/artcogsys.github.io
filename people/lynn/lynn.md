The visual cortex represents stimuli in a complex and nonlinear way. I want to gain a better understanding of the representations and the dynamics of complex neuronal activity in the visual cortex. I aim to do this by developing advanced and biologically plausible computer models that generate predictions of neural activity recorded in awake monkeys.
