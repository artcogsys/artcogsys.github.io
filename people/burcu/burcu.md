My interests lie in augmenting human capabilities with the help of intelligent artificial systems to empower people in reaching their full potential. I am especially curious about reinforcement learning, biologically plausible neural network models, and Bayesian methods for machine learning. During my PhD, I will be focusing on developing reinforcement learning algorithms for efficient closed-loop control of neural systems, in the specific context of generating optimal phosphene vision to restore some actionable perception for the visually impaired through neurotechnology.
