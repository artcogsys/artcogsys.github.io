The enormous success of deep learning in computer vision has sparked recent interest in applying deep learning in neuroimaging. But the dimensionality of rs-fMRI data is too high (~20 M), making it difficult to meaningfully process the data in its raw form for deep learning experiments. It is currently not clear how the data should be engineered to optimally extract the time information, and whether combining different representations of time could provide better results. In this paper, we explored various transformations that retain the full spatial resolution by summarizing the temporal dimension of the rs-fMRI data, therefore making it possible to train a full three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) even on a moderately sized [~2,000 from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)-I and II] data set. These transformations summarize the activity in each voxel of the rs-fMRI or that of the voxel and its neighbors to a single number. For each brain volume, we calculated regional homogeneity, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, local functional connectivity density, entropy, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, and auto-correlation lag. We trained the 3D-CNN on a publically available autism dataset to classify the rs-fMRI …"

Thus, fMRI scans are represented as 4-Dimensional (3-space + 1-time) tensors. And it is widely believed that the spatio-temporal patterns in fMRI manifests as behaviour and clinical symptoms. Because of the high dimensionality (1 Million) of fMRI, and the added constraints of limited cardinality of data sets, extracting such patterns are challenging. A standard approach to overcome these hurdles is to reduce the dimensionality of the data by either summarizing activation over time or space at the expense of possible loss of useful information. Here, we introduce an end-to-end algorithm capable of extracting spatiotemporal features from the full 4-D data using 3-D CNNs and 3-D Convolutional LSTMs. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available …"

For psychiatric disorders in particular, it is believed that one of the most promising modality is the resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), which captures the intrinsic connectivity between regions in the brain. Because rsfMRI data points are inherently high-dimensional (~1M), it is impossible to process the entire input in its raw form. In this paper, we propose a very simple transformation of the rsfMRI images that captures all of the temporal dynamics of the signal but sub-samples its spatial extent. As a result, we use a very simple 1-D convolutional network which is fast to train, requires minimal preprocessing and performs at par with the state-of-the-art on the classification of Autism spectrum disorders."

In this paper, we focus particularly on their use in autism classification. Most of the recent methods use graphs to leverage phenotypic information about subjects (patients or healthy controls) as additional contextual information. To do so, metadata such as age, gender and acquisition sites are utilized to define intricate relations (edges) between the subjects. We alleviate the use of such non-imaging metadata and propose a fully imaging-based approach where information from structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data are fused to construct the edges and nodes of the graph. To characterize each subject, we employ brain summaries. These are 3D images obtained from the 4D spatiotemporal resting-state fMRI data through summarization of the temporal activity of each voxel using neuroscientifically informed temporal measures such as amplitude low frequency fluctuations and entropy. Further, to extract features from these 3D brain summaries, we propose a 3D CNN model. We perform analysis on the open dataset for autism research (full ABIDE I-II) and show that by using simple brain summary measures and incorporating sMRI information, there is a noticeable increase in the generalizability and performance values of the framework as compared to state-of-the-art graph-based models."

This non-contact micromanipulation is done using the hydrodynamic forces instead of the interaction forces in contact manipulation, and hence eliminates the adhesive forces that decrease the chances of achieving successful releases. Motion of the cluster of microparticles results in a pressure gradient (within the vicinity of the microbead in a fluid) that derives and steers the microbeads without contact.

A paramount example of such data is the brain, which operates as a network, from the micro-scale of neurons, to the macro-scale of regions. This organization deemed GNNs a natural tool of choice to model brain activity, and have consequently attracted a lot of attention in the neuroimaging community. Yet, the advantage of adopting these models over conventional methods has not yet been assessed in a systematic way to gauge if GNNs are capable of leveraging the underlying structure of the data to improve learning. In this work, we study and evaluate the performance of five popular GNN architectures in diagnosing major depression disorder and autism spectrum disorder in two multi-site clinical datasets, and sex classification on the UKBioBank, from functional brain scans under a general uniform framework. Our results show that GNNs fail to outperform kernel-based and structure-agnostic deep learning models, in which 1D CNNs outperform the other methods in all scenarios. We highlight that creating optimal graph structures for functional brain data is a major bottleneck hindering the performance of GNNs, where existing works use arbitrary measures to define the edges resulting in noisy graphs. We therefore propose to integrate graph diffusion into existing architectures and show that it can alleviate this problem and improve their performance. Our results call for increased moderation and rigorous validation when evaluating graph methods and advocate for more data-centeric approaches in developing GNNs for functional …"

We present a two-stage framework to improve the diagnosis of heterogeneous psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). First, we propose a self-supervised mask prediction task on data from healthy individuals that can exploit differences between healthy controls and patients in clinical datasets. Next, we train a supervised classifier on the learned discriminative representations. To model rs-fMRI data, we develop Graph-S4; an extension to the recently proposed state-space model S4 to graph settings where the underlying graph structure is not known in advance. We show that combining the framework and Graph-S4 can significantly improve the diagnostic performance of neuroimaging-based single subject prediction models of MDD and ASD on three open-source multi-center rs-fMRI clinical datasets."

            "abstract": "In recent years, the collection and sharing of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets across multiple centers have enabled studying psychiatric disorders at scale, and prompted the application of statistically powerful tools such as deep neural networks. Yet, multi-center datasets introduce non-biological heterogeneity that can confound the biological signal of interest and produce erroneous findings. To mitigate this problem, the neuroimaging community has adopted harmonization techniques previously proposed in other domains to remove site-effects from fMRI data. The reported success of these approaches in improving the generalization of the models have varied significantly. It remains unclear whether harmonization techniques could boost the final outcome of multi-site fMRI studies, to what extent, and which approaches are best suited for this task. In an attempt to objectively answer these questions, we conduct a standardized rigorous evaluation of seven different harmonization techniques from the neuroimaging and computer vision literature on two large-scale multi-site datasets (N = 2169 and N = 2366) to diagnose autism spectrum disorder and major depression disorder from static and dynamic representations of fMRI data. Interestingly, while all harmonization techniques removed site-effects from the data, they had little influence on disorder classification performance in standard k-fold and leave-one-site-out validation settings over a well-tuned baseline. Further investigation shows that the baseline model implicitly learns site-invariant features which could well explain its competitiveness with explicit …"

The large majority of learning approaches applied today rely either on static representations or on short-term temporal correlations. This is at odds with the nature of brain activity which is dynamic and exhibit both short- and long-range dependencies. Further, new sophisticated deep learning approaches have been developed and validated on single tasks/datasets. The application of these models for the study of a different targets typically require exhaustive hyperparameter search, model engineering and trial and error to obtain competitive results with simpler linear models. This in turn limit their adoption and hinder fair benchmarking in a rapidly developing area of research. To this end, we propose fMRI-S4; a versatile deep learning model for the classification of phenotypes and psychiatric …"

            "abstract": "The unprecedented availability of large-scale datasets in neuroscience has spurred the exploration of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) both as empirical tools and as models of natural neural systems. Their appeal lies in their ability to approximate arbitrary functions directly from observations, circumventing the need for cumbersome mechanistic modeling. However, without appropriate constraints, DNNs risk producing implausible models, diminishing their scientific value. Moreover, the interpretability of DNNs poses a significant challenge, particularly with the adoption of more complex expressive architectures. In this perspective, we argue for universal differential equations (UDEs) as a unifying approach for model development and validation in neuroscience. UDEs view differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable mathematical objects that can be augmented and trained with scalable deep learning techniques. This synergy facilitates the integration of decades of extensive literature in calculus, numerical analysis, and neural modeling with emerging advancements in AI into a potent framework. We provide a primer on this burgeoning topic in scientific machine learning and demonstrate how UDEs fill in a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience. We outline a flexible recipe for modeling neural systems with UDEs and discuss how they can offer principled solutions to inherent challenges across diverse neuroscience applications such as understanding neural computation, controlling neural systems, neural decoding, and normative modeling."

            "abstract": "Foraging for resources in an environment is a fundamental activity that must be addressed by any biological agent. Thus, modelling this phenomenon in simulations can enhance our understanding of the characteristics of natural intelligence. In this work, we present a novel approach to modelling this phenomenon in silico. We achieve this by using a continuous coupled dynamical system for modelling the system. The dynamical system is composed of three differential equations, representing the position of the agent, the agent's control policy, and the environmental resource dynamics. Crucially, the control policy is implemented as a neural differential equation which allows the control policy to adapt in order to solve the foraging task. Using this setup, we show that when these dynamics are coupled and the controller parameters are optimized to maximize the rate of reward collected, adaptive foraging emerges in the agent. We further show that the internal dynamics of the controller, as a surrogate brain model, closely resemble the dynamics of the evidence accumulation mechanism, which may be used by certain neurons of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex region in non-human primates, for deciding when to migrate from one patch to another. Finally, we show that by modulating the resource growth rates of the environment, the emergent behaviour of the artificial agent agrees with the predictions of the optimal foraging theory."
