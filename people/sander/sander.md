I'm an external PhD student who studies biologically plausible approximations of the backpropagation algorithm. My research focuses on activity based learning: a form of learning where error signals are propagated using only information locally available at the synapse. Scaling these algorithms from toy problems to real world applications is one of the central themes in my work.
