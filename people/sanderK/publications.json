            "abstract": "Cortical responses to sensory stimuli are modulated by behavioral state. In the primary visual cortex (V1), visual responses of pyramidal neurons increase during locomotion. This response gain was suggested to be mediated through inhibitory neurons, resulting in the disinhibition of pyramidal neurons. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse V1, we reveal that locomotion increases the activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons during visual stimulation, challenging the disinhibition model. In darkness, while most VIP and PV neurons remained locomotion responsive, SST and excitatory neurons were largely non-responsive. Context-dependent locomotion responses were found in each cell type, with the highest proportion among SST neurons. These findings establish that modulation of neuronal activity by locomotion is context-dependent and contest the generality of a disinhibitory circuit for gain control of sensory responses by behavioral state.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14985.001"

Their analysis is computationally intensive and typically involves motion correction, image segmentation into regions of interest (ROIs), and extraction of fluorescence traces from each ROI. Out of focus fluorescence from surrounding neuropil and other cells can strongly contaminate the signal assigned to a given ROI. In this study, we introduce the FISSA toolbox (Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis) for neuropil decontamination. Given pre-defined ROIs, the FISSA toolbox automatically extracts the surrounding local neuropil and performs blind-source separation with non-negative matrix factorization. Using both simulated and in vivo data, we show that this toolbox performs similarly or better than existing published methods. FISSA …"

Meanwhile, most major advances in machine learning have been made with simpler, rate-based networks, with SNNs only recently showing competitive results, largely thanks to transferring insights from rate to spiking networks. However, it is still an open question exactly which computations SNNs perform. Recently, the time-averaged firing rates of several SNNs were shown to yield the solutions to convex optimization problems. Here we turn these findings around and show that virtually all inhibition-dominated SNNs can be understood through the lens of convex optimization, with network connectivity, timescales, and firing thresholds being intricately linked to the parameters of underlying convex optimization problems. This approach yields new, geometric insights into the computations performed by spiking networks. In particular, we establish a class of SNNs whose instantaneous output provides a solution to linear or quadratic programming problems, and we thereby reveal their input-output mapping. Using these insights, we derive local, supervised learning rules that can approximate given convex input-output functions, and we show that the resulting networks are consistent with many features from biological networks, such as low firing rates, irregular firing, E/I balance, and robustness to perturbations and synaptic delays."

Contextual modulation in primary visual cortex, in the form of association fields, is believed to play an important role in this process. Yet a unified and principled account of the good continuation law on the neural level is lacking. In this study we introduce a population model of primary visual cortex. Its contextual interactions depend on the elastica curvature energy of the smoothest contour connecting oriented bars. As expected, this model leads to association fields consistent with data. However, in addition the model displays tilt-illusions for stimulus configurations with grating and single bars that closely match psychophysics. Furthermore, the model explains not only pop-out of contours amid a variety of backgrounds, but also pop-out of single targets amid a uniform background. We thus …"

Additionally, for most existing control solutions network training or optimization is necessary, even for fully identified systems, complicating their implementation in on-chip low-power solutions. The neuroscience theory of Spike Coding Networks (SCNs) offers a fully analytical solution for implementing dynamical systems in recurrent spiking neural networks — while maintaining irregular, sparse, and robust spiking activity — but it’s not clear how to directly apply it to control problems.

While nonlinear computations can be implemented successfully in spiking neural networks, this requires supervised training and the resulting connectivity can be hard to interpret. In contrast, the required connectivity for any computation in the form of a linear dynamical system can be directly derived and understood with the spike coding network (SCN) framework. These networks also have biologically realistic activity patterns and are highly robust to cell death. Here we extend the SCN framework to directly implement any polynomial dynamical system, without the need for training. This results in networks requiring a mix of synapse types (fast, slow, and multiplicative), which we term multiplicative spike coding networks (mSCNs). Using mSCNs, we demonstrate how to directly derive the required connectivity for several nonlinear dynamical systems. We also show how to carry out higher-order polynomials with coupled networks that use only pair-wise multiplicative synapses, and provide expected numbers of connections for each synapse type. Overall, our work demonstrates a novel method for implementing nonlinear computations in spiking neural networks, while keeping the attractive features of standard SCNs (robustness, realistic activity patterns, and interpretable connectivity). Finally, we discuss the biological plausibility of our approach, and how the high accuracy and robustness of the approach may be of interest for neuromorphic computing."

In idealized situations where a single, continuous stimulus is encoded in a homogeneous population code, the value of an encoded stimulus can be read out without bias. Here we find that when multiple stimuli are simultaneously coded in the population, biases in the estimates of the stimuli and strong correlations between estimates can emerge. Although bias produced via this novel mechanism can be reduced by competitive coding and disappears in the complete absence of noise, the bias diminishes only slowly as a function of neural noise level. A Gaussian Process framework allows for accurate calculation of the bias and shows that a bimodal estimate distribution underlies the bias. The results have implications for neural coding and behavioral experiments."

The new field of neuromorphic engineering tries to tackle this problem by basing circuit design on brain architecture. There are two features of the brain that people try to implement especially: massive parallelism and plasticity. Synapse implementations, however, have proven difficult, due to a lack of inherently plastic circuit elements. This leads to the need of overly complex circuits to mimic any kind of plasticity. Recent developments in nanotechnology provide us with an exciting new opportunity: the memristor. The memristor is basically a resistor whose resistance depends on the amount of current that passed through it: effectively it is a plastic resistor. This is the first element of its kind and could potentially revolutionize the field of neuromorphic engineering. This paper will study the viability of the memristor as a plastic synapse by reviewing the recent developments in memristive technologies separately and in combination with known theories of plasticity in the brain. Memristors turn out to be very powerful for mimicking synaptic plasticity, but current research has focused too much on spiking based learning mechanisms and not enough experimental work has been done. It also seems the memristor-based learning rules could potentially improve our understanding of the underlying neuroscience, but little work has been done on this. Finally, despite promises of memristor-based circuitry being able to match the complexity and scale of the brain, current memristors would use too much energy. Future …"

In idealized situations where a single, continuous stimulus is encoded in a homogeneous population code, the value of the encoded stimulus can be read out without bias. However, in many situations, multiple stimuli are simultaneously present; for example, multiple motion patterns might overlap. Here we find that when multiple stimuli that overlap in their neural representation are simultaneously encoded in the population, biases in the read-out emerge. Although the bias disappears in the absence of noise, the bias is remarkably persistent at low noise levels. The bias can be reduced by competitive encoding schemes or by employing complex decoders. To study the origin of the bias, we develop a novel general framework based on gaussian processes that allows an accurate calculation of the …"

Despite their widespread use, it is challenging to fit sLMs to data, as their likelihood function is commonly intractable and the models non-differentiable. The adjacent field of agent-based modelling (ABM), faced with similar challenges, has recently introduced an approach to approximate gradients in network-controlled ABMs via reparameterization tricks. This approach enables efficient gradient-based optimization with automatic differentiation (AD), which allows for a directed local search of suitable parameters rather than estimation via black-box sampling. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using similar reparameterization tricks to fit sLMs through backpropagation of approximate gradients. We consider four common scenarios: fitting to single-state transitions, fitting to trajectories, inference of lattice states, and identification of stable lattice configurations. We demonstrate that all tasks can be solved by AD using four example sLMs from sociology, biophysics, image processing, and physical chemistry. Our results show that AD via approximate gradients is a promising method to fit sLMs to data for a wide variety of models and tasks."

The classical view is of a feedfoward system functioning as an edge detector, in which each cell has a receptive field (RF) and a preferred orientation. Whilst intuitive, this view is not the whole story. Although stimuli outside a neuron’s RF do not result in an increased response by themselves, they do modulate a neuron’s response to what’s inside its RF. We will refer to such extra-RF effects as contextual modulation. Contextual modulation is thought to underlie several perceptual phenomena, such as various orientation illusions and saliency of specific features (such as a contour or differing element). This gives a view of V1 as more than a collection of edge detectors, with neurons collectively extracting information beyond their RFs. However, many of the accounts linking psychophysics and physiology …"

The dependence of V1 neuron activity on center-surround interactions has been studied extensively (eg [2]). These center-surround interactions can be used to explain the tilt illusion, as they result in tuning curve modulations. When population activity is decoded using these modulated tuning curves, the tilt illusion arises [2]. In this work, we examine two factors affecting the tilt illusion:First, we examine is the effect of the tuning curve width on the tilt illusion. Tuning curves widths vary widely in vivo [3]. Although changes in tuning curve width due to center-surround interactions have been shown to potentially contribute to the tilt illusion [2, 4], how the tuning curve width itself affects the illusion is less well understood.
