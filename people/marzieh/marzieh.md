Hello, I'm Marzieh! 
I have a background in IC design and have experience creating an SRAM In-memory computing array. I'm diving into the exciting world of neuromorphic computing, exploring training SNNs with the DVS dataset, and implementing them on FPGA and other hardware. Super excited about the fun journey ahead!
