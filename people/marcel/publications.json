            "abstract": "Converging evidence suggests that the primate ventral visual pathway encodes increasingly complex stimulus features in downstream areas. We quantitatively show that there indeed exists an explicit gradient for feature complexity in the ventral pathway of the human brain. This was achieved by mapping thousands of stimulus features of increasing complexity across the cortical sheet using a deep neural network. Our approach also revealed a fine-grained functional specialization of downstream areas of the ventral stream. Furthermore, it allowed decoding of representations from human brain activity at an unsurpassed degree of accuracy, confirming the quality of the developed approach. Stimulus features that successfully explained neural responses indicate that population receptive fields were explicitly tuned for object categorization. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that object categorization is a …"

In this article we will review the critical steps of the BCI cycle, the present issues and state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we will develop a vision on how recently obtained results may contribute to new insights in neurocognition and, in particular, in the neural representation of perceived stimuli, intended actions and emotions.

In countless real-world domains, from legislation and law enforcement to healthcare, such diagnosis is essential to ensure that DNN decisions are driven by aspects appropriate in the context of its use. The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN’s decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field’s complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means “to explain” the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach’s “ability to explain”. This article offers a field guide to explore the space of explainable deep learning for those in the AI/ML field who are uninitiated. The field guide: i) Introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning, ii) discusses the evaluations for model explanations, iii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iv) discusses user-oriented explanation design and future directions. We hope the guide is seen as a starting point for those embarking on this research field."

Accordingly, perception has sometimes been cast as a process of inference, whereby sensory inputs are combined with prior knowledge. However, despite a wealth of behavioral literature supporting an account of perception as probabilistic inference, the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. One important question is whether top-down expectation biases stimulus representations in early sensory cortex, i.e., whether the integration of prior knowledge and bottom-up inputs is already observable at the earliest levels of sensory processing. Alternatively, early sensory processing may be unaffected by top-down expectations, and integration of prior knowledge and bottom-up input may take place in downstream association areas that are proposed to be involved in perceptual decision-making. Here, we implicitly manipulated human …"

In this study, we show that variation in moment-to-moment experienced vividness of visual imagery, within human subjects, depends on the activity of a large network of brain areas, including frontal, parietal, and visual areas. Furthermore, using a novel multivariate analysis technique, we show that the neural overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual system correlates with experienced imagery vividness.

Here, we review recent neuroimaging studies comparing these two forms of visual experience. Their results suggest that there is a large overlap in neural processing during perception and imagery: neural representations of imagined and perceived stimuli are similar in the visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. Furthermore, perception and imagery seem to rely on similar top-down connectivity. The most prominent difference is the absence of bottom-up processing during imagery. These findings fit well with the idea that imagery and perception rely on similar emulation or prediction processes."

We found an increase in bottom-up coupling during perception relative to baseline and an increase in top-down coupling during both perception and imagery, with a much stronger increase during imagery. Modulation of the coupling from frontal to early visual areas was common to both perception and imagery. Furthermore, we show that the experienced vividness during imagery was selectively associated with increases in top-down connectivity to early visual cortex. These results highlight the importance of top-down processing in internally as well as externally …"

This is motivated by BCIs being applicable for helping disabled, for gaming, and as a tool in cognitive neuroscience. Often, motor imagery is used to produce (binary) control signals. However, finding other types of control signals that allow the discrimination of multiple classes would help to increase the applicability of BCIs. We have investigated if modulation of posterior alpha activity by means of covert spatial attention in two dimensions can be reliably classified in single trials. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were collected for 15 subjects who were engaged in a task where they covertly had to visually attend left, right, up or down during a period of 2500 ms. We then classified the trials using support vector machines. The four orientations of covert attention could be reliably classified up to a maximum of 69% correctly classified trials …"

Impressive single-trial classification results have been reported in studies that used fMRI. Here, we investigate the possibility to identify conceptual representations from event-related EEG based on the presentation of an object in different modalities: its spoken name, its visual representation and its written name. We used Bayesian logistic regression with a multivariate Laplace prior for classification. Marked differences in classification performance were observed for the tested modalities. Highest accuracies (89% correctly classified trials) were attained when classifying object drawings. In auditory and orthographical modalities, results were lower though still significant for some subjects. The employed classification method allowed for a precise temporal localization of the features that contributed to the performance of the classifier for three modalities. These findings could help to further understand the mechanisms underlying conceptual representations. The study also provides a first step towards the use of concept decoding in the context of real-time brain-computer interface applications."

The objective was to create an image similar to the presented stimulus image through the previously trained generator. Using this approach we were able to reconstruct structural and some semantic features of a proportion of the natural images sets. A behavioural test showed that subjects were capable of identifying a reconstruction of the original stimulus in 67.2% and 66.4% of the cases in a pairwise comparison for the two natural image datasets respectively.

We here present electrocorticographic data from three male and one female human subject and demonstrate that gamma power is phase locked to traveling alpha waves. Given that alpha activity has been proposed to coordinate neuronal processing reflected in the gamma band, we suggest that alpha waves are involved in coordinating neuronal processing in both space and time."

The aim of this paper is to describe the considerations that must be taken into account when constructing a DBN for complex medical domains and to demonstrate their usefulness in practice. To this end, we focus on the construction of a DBN for prognosis of carcinoid patients, compare performance with that of a proportional hazards model, and describe predictions for three individual patients.

We propose a straightforward linear Gaussian approach, where decoding relies on the inversion of properly regularized encoding models, which can still be solved analytically. In order to test our approach we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data under a rapid event-related design in which subjects were presented with handwritten characters. Our approach is shown to yield state-of-the-art reconstructions of perceived characters as estimated from BOLD responses. This even holds for previously unseen characters. We propose that this framework serves as a baseline with which to compare more sophisticated models for which analytical inversion is infeasible."

            "abstract": "Encoding models are used for predicting brain activity in response to sensory stimuli with the objective of elucidating how sensory information is represented in the brain. Encoding models typically comprise a nonlinear transformation of stimuli to features (feature model) and a linear convolution of features to responses (response model). While there has been extensive work on developing better feature models, the work on developing better response models has been rather limited. Here, we investigate the extent to which recurrent neural network models can use their internal memories for nonlinear processing of arbitrary feature sequences to predict feature-evoked response sequences as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that the proposed recurrent neural network models can significantly outperform established response models by accurately estimating long-term dependencies that drive hemodynamic responses. The results open a new window into modeling the dynamics of brain activity in response to sensory stimuli."

Furthermore, many paradigms use intense visual stimulation, which can be irritating especially in long BCI sessions.

Covert shifts of visual attention induce changes in oscillatory alpha activity in posterior cortex, even in the absence of visual stimulation. The aim was to investigate whether different pairs of directions of attention shifts can be reliably differentiated based on the electroencephalogram. To this end, healthy participants (N = 8) had to strictly fixate a central dot and covertly shift visual attention to one out of six cued directions.Covert attention shifts induced a prolonged alpha synchronization over posterior electrode sites …"

Using a searchlight method, we were able to predict the stimulus category from the data while participants performed a semantic categorization task with 4 stimulus modalities (spoken and written names, photographs, and natural sounds). Significant classification performance was achieved in all 4 modalities. Modality-independent decoding was implemented by training and testing the searchlight method across modalities. This allowed the localization of those brain regions, which correctly discriminated between the categories, independent of stimulus modality.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, CNN representations of visual stimuli have previously been shown to correspond to processing stages in the ventral and dorsal streams of the visual system. Whether this correspondence between models and brain signals also holds for activity acquired at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. Here, we addressed this question by combining CNN-based encoding models with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Human participants passively viewed 1,000 images of objects while MEG signals were acquired. We modelled their high temporal resolution source-reconstructed cortical activity with CNNs, and observed a feed-forward sweep across the visual hierarchy …"

From the past few years, it also became an attractive research area in visual computing. From the computational point of view, by far speech and text have been the most considered cues of information for analyzing personality. However, recently there has been an increasing interest from the computer vision community in analyzing personality from visual data. Recent computer vision approaches are able to accurately analyze human faces, body postures and behaviors, and use these information to infer  apparent  personality traits. Because of the overwhelming research interest in this topic, and of the potential impact that this sort of methods could have in society, we present in this paper an up-to-date review of existing vision-based approaches for apparent personality trait recognition.

We here ask if the interaction between alpha and gamma oscillations is in the direction of the phase of slower oscillations driving the power of faster oscillations or conversely from the power of faster oscillations driving the phase of slower oscillations. To answer this question, we introduce a new measure to estimate the cross-frequency directionality (CFD).

In this paper, a large number of features known from the literature are explored for the recognition of such multi-stroke gestures. Features are computed from a global gesture shape. From its constituent strokes, the mean and standard deviation of each feature are computed. We show that using these new stroke-based features, significant improvements in classification accuracy can be obtained between 10% and 50% compared to global feature representations. These results are consistent over four different databases, containing iconic pen gestures, handwritten symbols, and upper-case characters. Compared to two other multi-stroke recognition techniques, improvements between 25% and 39% are achieved, averaged over all four databases."

During perception, visual activity is characterized by distinct processing stages, but the temporal dynamics underlying imagery remain unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of visual imagery in human participants using magnetoencephalography. Firstly, we show that, compared to perception, imagery decoding becomes significant later and representations at the start of imagery already overlap with later time points. This suggests that during imagery, the entire visual representation is activated at once or that there are large differences in the timing of imagery between trials. Secondly, we found consistent overlap between imagery and perceptual processing around 160 ms and from 300 ms after stimulus onset. This indicates that the N170 gets reactivated during imagery and that imagery does not rely on early perceptual representations. Together, these results provide important insights for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of visual imagery."

It is shown that, by rewriting the multivariate Laplace distribution as a scale mixture, we can incorporate spatio-temporal constraints which lead to smooth importance maps that facilitate subsequent interpretation. The posterior of interest is computed using an approximate inference method called expectation propagation and becomes feasible due to fast inversion of a sparse precision matrix. We illustrate the performance of the method on an fMRI dataset acquired while subjects were shown handwritten digits. The obtained models perform competitively in terms of predictive performance and give rise to interpretable importance maps. Estimation of the posterior of interest is shown to be feasible even for very large models with thousands of variables."

Common practice in P300 experiments and applications is that observers are asked to fixate their eyes while stimuli are presented. We investigated the possibility to differentiate between single target and nontarget fixations in a target search task involving eye movements by using EEG epochs synchronized to fixation onset (fixation-related potentials: FRPs). Participants systematically scanned search displays consisting of six small Landolt Cs in search of Cs with a particular orientation. After each search display, they indicated whether and where target Cs had been presented. As expected, an FRP component consistent with the P300 reliably distinguished between target and nontarget fixations. It was possible to classify single FRPs into target and nontarget FRPs above chance (on average 62% correct, where 50% would be chance). These results are the first step to practical applications such as covertly monitoring observers' interests and supporting search tasks."

Covert attention is the act of mentally focusing on a peripheral sensory stimulus without changing gaze direction. The ongoing brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography in subjects as they covertly attended to a moving cue while maintaining fixation. Based on posterior alpha power alone, the direction to which subjects were attending could be recovered using circular regression. Results show that the angle of attention could be predicted with a mean absolute deviation of 51° in our best subject. Averaged over subjects, the mean deviation was ∼70°.

We first construct a semi-simulated dataset containing a very large number of computer-generated face sketches with different styles and corresponding face images by expanding existing unconstrained face data sets. We then train models achieving state-of-the-art results on both computer-generated sketches and hand-drawn sketches by leveraging recent advances in deep learning such as batch normalization, deep residual learning, perceptual losses and stochastic optimization in combination with our new dataset. We finally demonstrate potential applications of our models in fine arts and forensic arts. In contrast to existing patch-based approaches, our deep-neural-network-based approach can be used for synthesizing photorealistic face images by inverting face sketches in the wild."

In this letter, we explore reconstruction based on a learned hierarchy of features by employing a hierarchical generative model that consists of conditional restricted Boltzmann machines. In an unsupervised phase, we learn a hierarchy of features from data, and in a supervised phase, we learn how brain activity predicts the states of those features. Reconstruction is achieved by sampling from the model, conditioned on brain activity. We show that by using the hierarchical generative model, we can obtain good-quality reconstructions of visual images of handwritten digits presented during an fMRI scanning session."

A BCI allows a subject to control a device by willfully changing his/her own brain activity. BCI therefore holds the promise as a tool for aiding the disabled and for augmenting human performance. While technical developments obviously are important, we will here argue that new insight gained from cognitive neuroscience can be used to identify signatures of neural activation which reliably can be modulated by the subject at will. This review will focus mainly on oscillatory activity in the alpha band which is strongly modulated by changes in covert attention. Besides developing BCIs for their traditional purpose, they might also be used as a research tool for cognitive neuroscience. There is currently a strong interest in how brain-state fluctuations impact cognition. These state fluctuations are partly reflected by ongoing oscillatory activity. The functional role of the brain state can be investigated by introducing stimuli in real-time to subjects depending on the actual state of the brain. This principle of brain-state dependent stimulation may also be used as a practical tool for augmenting human behavior. In conclusion, new approaches based on online analysis of ongoing brain activity are currently in rapid development. These approaches are amongst others informed by new insight gained from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography studies in cognitive neuroscience and hold the promise of providing new ways for investigating the brain at work."

We used reconstructed source-space time courses as input to the algorithm in order to localize brain regions involved in optimal image discrimination. Applying this method to the interval of 115 to 315 ms after stimulus onset, we show a focal localization of regression coefficients in the inferior occipital, middle occipital, and lingual gyrus that drive decoding of the different perceived image categories.

It is often hypothesised that a reversal in neural processing underlies the generation of mental images as abstract representations are used to construct sensory representations in the absence of sensory input. According to predictive processing theories, such reversed processing also plays a central role in later stages of perception. Direct experimental evidence of reversals in neural information flow has been missing. Here, we used a combination of machine learning and magnetoencephalography to characterise neural dynamics in humans. We provide direct evidence for a reversal of the perceptual feed-forward cascade during imagery and show that, during perception, such reversals alternate with feed-forward processing in an 11 Hz oscillatory pattern. Together, these results show how common feedback processes support both veridical perception and mental imagery."

In this Perspective article, we propose that arguing about the successes and failures of a restricted set of current ANNs is the wrong approach to assess the promise of neuroconnectionism for brain science. Instead, we take inspiration from the philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core of a scientific research programme is often not directly falsifiable but should be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights. Following this view, we present neuroconnectionism as a general research programme centred around ANNs as a computational …"

It is shown that classification performance can be improved by applying sparse logistic regression in order to select a subset of the sensors specific to each subject as the basis for classification. Furthermore, insight is gained into how classification performance changes as a function of the length of the attention period and as a function of the number of trials. Classification performance steadily increases as the length of the attention period over which is averaged is increased, although this does not necessarily translate into higher bit rates …"

In this study we present and evaluate several models that mimic this automatic social behavior.

Along with presenting our audiovisual approach and results that won the third place in the ChaLearn First Impressions Challenge, we investigate modeling in different modalities including audio only, visual only, language only, audiovisual, and combination of audiovisual and language. Our results demonstrate that the best performance could be obtained using a fusion of all data modalities. Finally, in order to promote explainability in machine learning and to provide an …"

Recent advances in computational modeling provide increasingly accurate predictions of how neural populations across the brain respond to complex naturalistic stimuli. The employed computational models, referred to as encoding models, explicitly transform complex stimuli into observed neural responses. This rapidly developing field is becoming increasingly important in sensory neuroscience as it provides detailed insights into the functional organization of neural representations. The present work starts by discussing the theoretical underpinnings of encoding models. Next, various applications of encoding models are reviewed. Finally, potential research directions that may shape future work in this area of research are described."

Our algorithm combines the free energy principle from neuroscience, rooted in variational inference, with deep convolutional decoders to scale the algorithm to directly deal with raw visual input and provide online adaptive inference. Our approach is validated by studying body perception and action in a simulated and a real Nao robot. Results show that our approach allows the robot to perform 1) dynamical body estimation of its arm using only monocular camera images and 2) autonomous reaching to “imagined” arm poses in visual space. This suggests that robot and human body perception and action can be efficiently solved by viewing both as an active inference problem guided by ongoing sensory input."

When these artifacts are not purely random, but consistent regarding certain stimuli or conditions, the possibility arises that eye movements are actually inducing effects in the MEG signal. It remains unclear how much of an influence eye movements can have on observed effects in MEG, since most MEG studies lack a control analysis to verify whether an effect found in the MEG signal is induced by eye movements. Here, we find that we can decode stimulus location from eye movements in two different stages of a working memory match-to-sample task that encompass different areas of research typically done with MEG …"

To overcome the challenge of formalizing what stimulus features should modulate single voxel responses, we introduce a general approach for making directly testable predictions of single voxel responses to statistically adapted representations of ecologically valid stimuli. These representations are learned from unlabeled data without supervision. Our approach is validated using a parsimonious computational model of (i) how early visual cortical representations are adapted to statistical regularities in natural images and (ii) how populations of these representations are pooled by single voxels. This computational model is used to predict single voxel responses to natural images and identify natural images from stimulus-evoked multiple voxel responses. We show that statistically adapted low-level sparse and invariant representations of natural images better span the space of early visual cortical representations and can be more effectively exploited in stimulus identification than hand-designed Gabor wavelets. Our results demonstrate the potential of our approach to better probe unknown cortical representations."

These DNNs were subsequently used to probe the neural representations of music. Representational similarity analysis revealed the existence of a representational gradient across the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Anterior STG was shown to be more sensitive to low-level stimulus features encoded in shallow DNN layers whereas posterior STG was shown to be more sensitive to high-level stimulus features encoded in deep DNN layers."

These correlations can be caused either by direct communication via active axonal pathways or indirectly via the interaction with other regions. It is not possible to discriminate between these two kinds of functional interaction simply by considering the covariance matrix. However, the non-diagonal elements of its inverse, the precision matrix, can be naturally related to direct communication between brain areas and interpreted in terms of partial correlations. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model for functional connectivity analysis which allows estimation of a posterior density over precision matrices, and, consequently, allows one to quantify the uncertainty about estimated partial correlations.

In contrast, multivariate approaches that use classification as a basis are well-suited to detect such interactions, allowing the analysis of neuroimaging data on the single trial level. However, multivariate approaches typically assign a non-zero contribution to every component, making interpretation of the results troublesome. This paper introduces groupwise regularisation as a novel method for finding sparse, and therefore easy to interpret, models that are able to predict the experimental condition to which single trials belong. Furthermore, the obtained models can be constrained in various ways by placing features extracted from the data that are thought to belong together into groups.

We represent the MVL distribution as a scale mixture that induces a coupling between source variances instead of their means. Approximation of the posterior marginals using expectation propagation is shown to be very efficient due to properties of the scale mixture representation. The computational bottleneck amounts to computing the diagonal elements of a sparse matrix inverse. Our approach is illustrated using a mismatch negativity paradigm for which MEG data and a structural MRI have been acquired. We show that spatial coupling leads to sources which are active over larger cortical areas as compared with an uncoupled prior."

Wasserstein variational inference uses a new family of divergences that includes both f-divergences and the Wasserstein distance as special cases. The gradients of the Wasserstein variational loss are obtained by backpropagating through the Sinkhorn iterations. This technique results in a very stable likelihood-free training method that can be used with implicit distributions and probabilistic programs. Using the Wasserstein variational inference framework, we introduce several new forms of autoencoders and test their robustness and performance against existing variational autoencoding techniques."

We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training points. The weights are determined by the outer layer of a deep neural network, trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling. In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally, our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture, the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the quantized softmax approach."

The presence, location and orientation of these white matter tracts can be derived using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in combination with probabilistic tractography. Unfortunately, as of yet, none of the existing approaches provide an undisputed way of inferring brain networks from the streamline distributions which tractography produces. State-of-the-art methods rely on an arbitrary threshold or, alternatively, yield weighted results that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we provide a generative model that explicitly describes how structural brain networks lead to observed streamline distributions. This allows us to draw principled conclusions about brain networks, which we validate using simultaneously acquired resting-state functional MRI data. Inference may be further informed by …"

It models the neural computations in multiple brain regions and can be trained end-to-end via stochastic gradient descent from noninvasive data. NIF models represent neural information processing via a network of coupled tensors, each encoding the representation of the sensory input contained in a brain region. The elements of these tensors can be interpreted as cortical columns whose activity encodes the presence of a specific feature in a spatiotemporal location. Each tensor is coupled to the measured data specific to a brain region via low-rank observation models that can be decomposed into the spatial, temporal and feature receptive fields of a localized neuronal population. Both these observation models and the convolutional weights defining the information processing within regions are learned end-to-end by predicting the neural signal during sensory stimulation. We trained a NIF model on the activity of early visual areas using a large-scale fMRI dataset recorded in a single participant. We show that we can recover plausible visual representations and population receptive fields that are consistent with empirical findings."

It postulates that the brain continuously inhibits predictable sensory input, ensuring preferential processing of surprising elements. A central aspect of this view is its hierarchical connectivity, involving recurrent message passing between excitatory bottom-up signals and inhibitory top-down feedback. Here we use computational modeling to demonstrate that such architectural hardwiring is not necessary. Rather, predictive coding is shown to emerge as a consequence of energy efficiency. When training recurrent neural networks to minimize their energy consumption while operating in predictive environments, the networks self-organize into prediction and error units with appropriate inhibitory and excitatory interconnections and learn to inhibit predictable sensory input.

We show that using a multi-fiber network (MF-Net) in conjunction with data augmentation strategies within-setup dataset performance improves over the conventional RBR system. Two new methods for video augmentation were used: video cutout and dynamic illumination change.

The restored prosthetic percept is rudimentary compared to normal vision and can be optimized with a variety of image preprocessing techniques to maximize relevant information transfer. Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a nontrivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments, we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The results of these proof-of-principle experiments illustrate the potential of end-to-end optimization for prosthetic vision. The presented approach is highly modular and our approach could be extended to automated dynamic optimization of prosthetic vision for everyday tasks, given any specific constraints, accommodating individual requirements of the end-user."

During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information. Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs and using 24 extracted features per USV, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features. The same network architecture was also able to achieve above-chance classification for cortexless mice, which were considered indistinguishable before. In summary, spectrotemporal differences between male and female USVs allow at least their partial classification, which enables sexual recognition between …"

The involvement of low-level visual areas such as V1 and V2 is not yet clear, while several high-level structures such as the lateral occipital complex and fusiform face area seem invariant to occlusion of objects and faces, respectively, and several motor areas seem to code for object permanence. The variety of results on the timing of …"

Previous research showed the propagation of low-level acoustic features of speech from posterior superior temporal gyrus toward anterior superior temporal gyrus in the human brain . In this study, we investigate what happens to these neural representations past the superior temporal gyrus and how they engage higher-level language processing areas such as inferior frontal gyrus. We used low-level sound features to model neural responses to speech outside of the primary auditory cortex. Two complementary imaging techniques were used with human participants (both males and females): electrocorticography (ECoG) and fMRI. Both imaging techniques showed tuning of the perisylvian cortex to low-level speech features. With ECoG, we found evidence of …"

Using an innovative data-driven state segmentation method, we investigate how neural states are organized across the cortical hierarchy and where in the cortex neural state boundaries and perceived event boundaries overlap. Our results show that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions, and long states in lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. State boundaries are shared within and between groups of brain regions that resemble well-known functional networks. Perceived event boundaries overlap with neural state boundaries across large parts of the cortical hierarchy, particularly when those state boundaries demarcate a strong transition or are shared between brain regions. Taken together, these findings suggest that a partially nested cortical hierarchy of neural states forms the basis of event segmentation."

In particular we focus on the reconstruction of natural images from BOLD responses in visual cortex. We expand our linear Gaussian framework for percept decoding with Gaussian mixture models to better represent the prior distribution of natural images. Reconstruction of such images then boils down to probabilistic inference in a hybrid Bayesian network. In our set-up, different mixture components correspond to different character categories. Our framework can automatically infer higher-order semantic categories from lower-level brain areas. Furthermore, the framework can gate semantic information from higher-order brain areas to enforce the correct category during reconstruction. When categorical information is not available, we show that automatically learned clusters in the data give a similar improvement in reconstruction. The hybrid Bayesian network leads to highly accurate reconstructions in both supervised and unsupervised settings."

Accurate methods for identifying such activity changes are important to allow further investigation of the neural basis of event segmentation and its link to the temporal processing hierarchy of the brain. In this study, we introduce a new set of elegant and simple methods to study these mechanisms. We introduce a method for identifying the boundaries between neural states in a brain area and a complementary one for identifying the number of neural states.

In previous work, under attempted fixation and passive viewing, we found no evidence for systematic eye movements. Here, however, we show that participants’ eye movements are systematic under attempted fixation when active viewing is demanded by the task. Since eye movements directly affect early visual cortex activity, commonly used for neural decoding, our findings imply alternative explanations for previously reported results in neural …"

We here ask if such allocation of resources by alpha oscillations generalizes to long-term memory encoding in a cross-modal setting in which we acquired the ongoing brain activity using magnetoencephalography. Participants were asked to encode pictures while ignoring simultaneously presented words and vice versa. We quantified the brain activity during rehearsal reflecting subsequent memory in the different attention conditions.

            "abstract": "Traditional backpropagation of error, though a highly successful algorithm for learning in artificial neural network models, includes features which are biologically implausible for learning in real neural circuits. An alternative called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural network into layer-wise and plausible ‘targets’ for every unit. These targets can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically, backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer."

As gold standard we use the connectivity matrix obtained invasively with histological tracers by Markov et al. (2014). As performance metric, we use cross entropy as a measure that enables comparison of the relative tracer labeled neuron counts to the streamline counts from tractography. We find that high angular resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio are important to estimate SC, and that SC derived from low image resolution (1.03 mm3) are in better agreement with the tracer network, than those derived from high image …"

            "abstract": "A fundamental assumption in neuroscience is that brain function is constrained by its structural properties. This motivates the idea that the brain can be parcellated into functionally coherent regions based on anatomical connectivity patterns that capture how different areas are interconnected. Several studies have successfully implemented this idea in humans using diffusion weighted MRI, allowing parcellation to be conducted in vivo. Two distinct approaches to connectivity-based parcellation can be identified. The first uses the connection profiles of brain regions as a feature vector, and groups brain regions with similar connection profiles together. Alternatively, one may adopt a network perspective that aims to identify clusters of brain regions that show dense within-cluster and sparse between-cluster connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model for connectivity-based parcellation that unifies both approaches. Using the model we are able to obtain a parcellation of the human brain whose clusters may adhere to either interpretation. We find that parts of the connectome consistently cluster as densely connected components, while other parts consistently result in clusters with similar connections. Interestingly, the densely connected components consist predominantly of major cortical areas, while the clusters with similar connection profiles consist of regions that have previously been identified as the ‘rich club’; regions known for their integrative role in connectivity. Furthermore, the probabilistic model allows quantification of the uncertainty in cluster assignments. We show that, while most clusters are clearly delineated, some …"

We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance.We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a covert orientation discrimination task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3.5°) or far (7°) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block.Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1.85 s and 2.25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65.9%) than in the easy task condition (61.1%). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate.Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand. Further research is …"

However, the performance of the variational approach depends on the choice of an appropriate variational family. Here, we introduce automatic structured variational inference (ASVI), a fully automated method for constructing structured variational families, inspired by the closed-form update in conjugate Bayesian models. These pseudo-conjugate families incorporate the forward pass of the input probabilistic program and can therefore capture complex statistical dependencies. Pseudo-conjugate families have the same space and time complexity of the input probabilistic program and are therefore tractable for a very large family of models including both continuous and discrete variables. We validate our automatic variational method on a wide range of both low-and high-dimensional inference problems. We find that ASVI provides a clear improvement in performance when compared with other popular approaches such as mean field family and inverse autoregressive flows. We provide a fully automatic open source implementation of ASVI in TensorFlow Probability."

We developed a new decoding method called sparse orthonormalized partial least squares (SOPLS) which was tested on a subset of the data used in Chao et al (2010)(freely obtainable from neurotycho. org (Nagasaka et al 2011 PLoS ONE 6 e22561)).

By using machine learning techniques it is possible to analyse and classify short traces of brain activity, which could, for example, be used to build a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This article describes an experiment where subjects were presented with word pairs and asked to decide whether the words were related or not. A classifier was trained to determine whether the subjects judged words as related or unrelated based on one second of EEG data. The results show that the classifier accuracy when training per subject varies between 54% and 67%, and is significantly above chance level for all subjects (N  = 12) and the accuracy when training over subjects varies between 51% and 63%, and is significantly above chance level for 11 subjects, pointing to a general effect."

It is well known that when covert attention is directed to the left visual hemifield, posterior alpha activity decreases in the right hemisphere while simultaneously increasing in the left hemisphere and vice versa. However, it remains unknown if and how the classical lateralization pattern depends on the eccentricity of the locations to which one attends. In this paper we study the effect of target eccentricity on the performance of a brain computer interface system that is driven by covert attention. Results show that the lateralization pattern becomes more pronounced as target eccentricity increases and suggest that in the current design the minimum eccentricity for having an acceptable classification performance for two targets at equal distance from fixation in …"

The purpose of the current study was to examine the extent to which HIV infection in virologically suppressed patients is associated with disruptions in subcortical regions of the brain in comparison to a matched HIV-negative control group. The sample consisted of 72 patients and 39 controls included between January 2012 and January 2014.

In this letter, we propose a Bayesian formulation of PLS along with some extensions. In a nutshell, we provide sparsity at the input space level and an automatic estimation of the optimal number of latent components. We follow the variational approach to infer the parameter distributions. We have successfully tested the proposed methods on a synthetic data benchmark and on electrocorticogram data associated with several motor outputs in monkeys."

That is, we formulate a conditional random field over a four-connected graph as end-to-end trainable convolutional and recurrent networks, and estimate them via an adversarial process. Importantly, our model learns not only unary potentials but also pairwise potentials, while aggregating multi-scale contexts and controlling higher-order inconsistencies. We evaluate our model on two standard benchmark datasets for semantic face segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on both of them."

Here we asked whether the altered auditory perception due to the McGurk illusion affects subsequent auditory perception, ie whether this process of fusion may cause a recalibration of the auditory boundaries between phonemes. Participants categorized auditory and audiovisual speech stimuli as/aba/,/ada/or/aga/while activity patterns in their auditory cortices were recorded using fMRI.

A Bayesian hierarchical model was used, allowing us to simultaneously study group-level effects as well as effects for individual participants. We found strong effects of both imagery as well as its interaction with sensory evidence within individual participants. However, the direction of these effects were highly variable between individuals, leading to weak effects at the group level. This highlights the …"

As an alternative approach, we propose to optimize stimulation patterns by end-to-end training of a feature extractor using deep reinforcement learning agents in virtual environments. We present a task-oriented evaluation framework to compare different stimulus generation mechanisms, such as static edge-based and adaptive end-to-end approaches like the one introduced here.

These predictions can be critical for individuals in many scenarios (eg, hiring an applicant). However, these predictions in and of themselves might be deemed to be untrustworthy without further supportive evidence in such scenarios. Through a series of experiments on a recently released benchmark dataset for automatic apparent personality trait prediction, this paper characterizes the audio and visual information that is used by a state-of-the-art model while making its predictions so as to provide such supportive evidence by explaining these predictions. Additionally, it describes a new web application, which gives feedback on apparent personality traits of its users by combining model predictions with their explanations."

            "abstract": "Functional connectivity concerns the correlated activity between neuronal populations in spatially segregated regions of the brain, which may be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This coupled activity is conveniently expressed using covariance, but this measure fails to distinguish between direct and indirect effects. A popular alternative that addresses this issue is partial correlation, which regresses out the signal of potentially confounding variables, resulting in a measure that reveals only direct connections. Importantly, provided the data are normally distributed, if two variables are conditionally independent given all other variables, their respective partial correlation is zero. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic generative model that allows us to estimate functional connectivity in terms of both partial correlations and a graph representing conditional independencies. Simulation results show that this methodology is able to outperform the graphical LASSO, which is the de facto standard for estimating partial correlations. Furthermore, we apply the model to estimate functional connectivity for twenty subjects using resting-state fMRI data. Results show that our model provides a richer representation of functional connectivity as compared to considering partial correlations alone. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be extended in several ways, for instance to achieve data fusion by informing the conditional independence graph with data from probabilistic tractography. As our Bayesian formulation of functional connectivity provides access to the posterior distribution instead of only to point estimates, we are …"

However, these models are not as widely applied as they could, as their behavior is often not well-understood. One approach is to employ qualitative probabilistic network theory in order to derive a qualitative characterization of ICI models. In this paper we analyze the qualitative properties of ICI models with binary random variables. Qualitative properties are shown to follow from the characteristics of the Boolean function underlying the model. In addition, it is demonstrated that the theory also allows finding constraints on the model parameters given knowledge of the qualitative properties. This high-level qualitative characterization offers a new way of identifying suitable ICI models and may facilitate their exploitation in developing real-world Bayesian networks."

However, it remains unclear whether the phase of theta oscillations controls the power of slow and fast gamma activity or vice versa. We here applied spectral Granger causality, phase slope index and a newly developed cross‐frequency directionality (CFD) measure to investigate directional interactions between local field potentials recorded within and across hippocampal subregions of CA1 and CA3 of freely exploring rats. Given the well‐known CA3 to CA1 anatomical connection, we hypothesized that interregional directional interactions were constrained by anatomical connection, and within‐frequency and cross‐frequency directional interactions were always from CA3 to CA1.

First, a whole‐brain classifier was trained on pictures of faces and places. Subjects then saw transparently overlapped pictures of a face and a place, and attended to only one of them while ignoring the other. The category of the attended object, face or place, was decoded on a scan‐by‐scan basis using the previously trained decoder. The decoder performed at 77.6% accuracy indicating that despite competing bottom‐up sensory input, object‐based visual attention biased neural patterns towards that of the …"

Recurrent neural networks are ideal models to gain insight in how information is processed by such a hierarchy of time scales and have become widely used to model temporal dynamics both in machine learning and computational neuroscience. However, in the derivation of such models as discrete time approximations of the firing rate of a population of neurons, the time constants of the neuronal process are generally ignored. Learning these time constants could inform us about the time scales underlying temporal processes in the brain and enhance the expressive capacity of the network. To investigate the potential of adaptive time constants, we compare the standard approximations to a more lenient one that accounts for the time scales at …"

Here, we describe a deep active inference agent in a virtual environment, which we subjected to the RHI, that is able to account for these results.

We recorded a densely sampled large fMRI dataset (TR=700 ms) in a single individual exposed to spatiotemporal visual and auditory naturalistic stimuli (30 episodes of BBC’s Doctor Who). The data consists of 120.830 whole-brain volumes (approx. 23 h) of single-presentation data (full episodes, training set) and 1.178 volumes (11 min) of repeated narrative short episodes (test set, 22 repetitions), recorded with fixation over a period of six months.

Here we propose to model this causal interaction using integro-differential equations and causal kernels that allow for a rich analysis of effective connectivity. The approach combines the tractability and flexibility of autoregressive modeling with the biophysical interpretability of dynamic causal modeling. The causal kernels are learned nonparametrically using Gaussian process regression, yielding an efficient framework for causal inference. We construct a novel class of causal covariance functions that enforce the desired properties of the causal kernels, an approach which we call GP CaKe. By construction, the model and its hyperparameters have biophysical meaning and are therefore easily interpretable. We demonstrate the efficacy of GP CaKe on a number of simulations and give an example of a realistic application on magnetoencephalography (MEG) data."

This prediction is achieved by representing the stimulus in terms of a suitable feature space and using this feature space to linearly predict observed neural responses. Here, we investigate to what extent semantic vector space models can be used to predict neural responses to complex visual stimuli. We show that these models provide good predictions of neural responses in downstream visual areas, improving significantly over a low-level control model based on Gabor wavelet pyramids. The outlined approach provides a new way to model and map high-level semantic representations across cortex."

Although an artificially generated prosthetic percept is relatively limited compared with normal vision, it may provide some elementary perception of the surroundings, re-enabling daily living functionality. For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection. A simulated electrode resolution of 26× 26 was found to provide sufficient information for mobility in a simple environment. Our results suggest that, for a lower number of implanted electrodes, the removal of background textures and within-surface gradients may be beneficial in theory. However, the deep learning-based implementation for surface boundary detection did not improve mobility performance in the current study. Furthermore, our findings indicate that, for a greater number of electrodes, the removal of within-surface gradients and background textures …"

These findings extend the decoding results for static gratings and are of importance in the decoding of ongoing changes in mental state."

The solution of the resulting optimal transport problem provides both a particle approximation and a set of optimal transportation densities that map each particle to a segment of the posterior distribution.

The presence, location and orientation of these white matter tracts can be derived using diffusion MRI in combination with probabilistic tractography. Unfortunately, as of yet no approaches have been suggested that provide an undisputed way of inferring brain networks from tractography. In this paper, we provide a computational framework which we refer to as Bayesian connectomics. Rather than applying an arbitrary threshold to obtain a single network, we consider the posterior distribution of networks that are supported by the data, combined with an exponential random graph (ERGM) prior that captures a priori knowledge concerning the graph-theoretical properties of whole-brain networks. We show that, on simulated probabilistic tractography data, our approach is able to reconstruct whole-brain networks. In addition, our approach directly supports multi-model data fusion and group-level network inference."

We prove that our new variational loss is optimized by the exact posterior marginals in the fully factorized mean-field approximation, a property that is not shared with the more conventional reverse KL inference. Furthermore, we show that forward amortized inference can be easily marginalized over large families of latent variables in order to obtain a marginalized variational posterior. We consider two examples of variational marginalization. In our first example we train a Bayesian forecaster for predicting a simplified chaotic model of atmospheric convection. In the second example we train an amortized variational approximation of a Bayesian optimal classifier by marginalizing over the model space. The result is a powerful meta-classification network that can solve arbitrary classification problems without further training."

These measures require an estimate of whole-brain structural connectivity for which one may resort to deterministic or thresholded probabilistic streamlining procedures. While these procedures have provided important insights about the characteristics of human brain networks, they ultimately rely on unwarranted assumptions such as those of noise-free data or the use of an arbitrary threshold. Therefore, resulting structural connectivity estimates as well as derived graph measures fail to fully take into account the inherent uncertainty in the structural estimate. In this paper, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining posterior distributions over graph metrics using Bayesian inference. It is shown that this posterior distribution can be used to quantify uncertainty about graph-theoretical measures at the single subject level, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the graph-theoretical properties of human brain connectivity. We refer to this model-based approach to connectivity analysis as Bayesian connectomics."

This means that any representational overlap could be because of overlap in feedback processes. In the current study, we aimed to investigate this issue by characterizing the overlap between feedforward- and feedback-initiated category representations during imagined stimuli, conscious perception, and unconscious processing using fMRI in humans of either sex.

Traditionally, a distinction between lower- and higher-level sound features is made, but their definition depends on a specific theoretical framework and might not match the neural representation of sound. Here, we postulate that constructing a data-driven neural model of auditory perception, with a minimum of theoretical assumptions about the relevant sound features, could provide an alternative approach and possibly a better match to the neural responses. We collected electrocorticography recordings from six patients who watched a long-duration feature film. The raw movie soundtrack was used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the associated neural responses. The model achieved high prediction accuracy and generalized well to a second dataset, where new participants watched a different film. The extracted bottom-up features captured acoustic properties that were specific to the type of sound and were associated with various response latency profiles and distinct cortical distributions. Specifically, several features encoded speech-related acoustic properties with some features exhibiting shorter latency profiles (associated with responses in posterior perisylvian cortex) and others exhibiting longer latency profiles (associated with responses in anterior perisylvian cortex). Our results support and extend the current view on speech perception by demonstrating the presence of temporal hierarchies in the perisylvian cortex and involvement of cortical sites outside of this region during audiovisual speech perception."

In particular, how active inference, a mathematical formulation of how the brain resists a natural tendency to disorder, provides a unified recipe to potentially solve some of the major challenges in robotics, such as adaptation, robustness, flexibility, generalization and safe interaction. This paper summarizes some experiments and lessons learned from developing such a computational model on real embodied platforms, i.e., humanoid and industrial robots.

Here we present a new method for reconstructing naturalistic images and videos from very large single-participant functional magnetic resonance imaging data that leverages the recent success of image-to-image transformation networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial information obtained from retinotopic mappings across the visual system. More specifically, we first determine what position each voxel in a particular region of interest would represent in the visual field based on its corresponding receptive field location. Then, the 2D image representation of the brain activity on the visual field is passed to a fully convolutional image-to-image network trained to recover the original stimuli using VGG feature loss with an adversarial regularizer. In our experiments, we show that our method offers a significant improvement over existing video reconstruction techniques."

We tested whether these representations were useful in studying the human brain data. To this end, we collected electrocorticography responses to a short movie from 37 subjects and fitted their cortical patterns across multiple regions using the semantic components extracted from film frames.

These networks offer an exciting new tool for neuroscience that can give us insight in the emergence of neural and behavioral mechanisms. A big gap remains though between the very deep neural networks that have risen in popularity and outperformed many existing shallow networks in the field of computer vision and the highly recurrently connected human brain. This trend towards ever-deeper architectures raises the question why the brain has not developed such an architecture. Besides wiring constraints we argue that the brain operates under different circumstances when performing object recognition, being confronted with noisy and ambiguous sensory input. The role of time in the process of object recognition is investigated, showing that a recurrent network trained through reinforcement learning is able to learn the amount of time needed to arrive at an accurate estimate of the stimulus and develops behavioral and neural mechanisms similar to those found in the human and non-human primate literature."

We observed that visual category information related to the difference between faces and objects became apparent in the occipital lobe after 63 ms. Within the next 110 ms, activation spread out to include the temporal lobe before returning to residing mainly in the occipital lobe again. After stimulus offset, a peak in information was observed, comparable to the peak after stimulus onset. Moreover, similar processes, albeit not identical, seemed to underlie both peaks. Information about the categorical identity of the stimulus remained present until 677 ms after stimulus offset, during which period the stimulus had to be retained in working memory. Activation patterns initially resembled those observed during stimulus presentation. After about 200 ms, however, this representation changed and class-specific activity became more equally distributed over the four lobes. These results show that, although there are common processes underlying stimulus representation both during and after stimulus presentation, these representations change depending on the specific stage of perception and maintenance."

The accurate identification of DNMs from sequencing data is therefore fundamental to rare disease research and diagnostics. Unfortunately, identifying reliable DNMs remains a major challenge due to sequence errors, uneven coverage, and mapping artifacts. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) DNM caller (DeNovoCNN), that encodes the alignment of sequence reads for a trio as 160164 resolution images. DeNovoCNN was trained on DNMs of 5616 whole exome sequencing (WES) trios achieving total 96.74% recall and 96.55% precision on the test dataset. We find that DeNovoCNN has increased recall/sensitivity and precision compared to existing DNM calling approaches (GATK, DeNovoGear, DeepTrio, Samtools) based on the Genome in a Bottle reference dataset and independent WES and …"

At the same time, we are witnessing exciting developments in natural language processing where large-scale neural network models can be used to instantiate cognitive hypotheses in narrative processing. Yet, they learn from text alone and we lack ways of incorporating biological constraints during training. To mitigate this gap, we provide a narrative comprehension magnetoencephalography (MEG) data resource that can be used to train neural network models directly on brain data. We recorded from 3 participants, 10 separate recording hour-long sessions each, while they listened to audiobooks in English. After story listening, participants answered short questions about their experience. To minimize head movement, the participants wore MEG-compatible head casts, which immobilized their head position during …"

Still, our understanding of how the human brain relates to behavior in the real world and how this link is modulated by biological, social, and environmental factors is limited. To address this, we designed the Healthy Brain Study (HBS), an interdisciplinary, longitudinal, cohort study based on multidimensional, dynamic assessments in both the laboratory and the real world. Here, we describe the rationale and design of the currently ongoing HBS. The HBS is examining a population-based sample of 1,000 healthy participants (age 30–39) who are thoroughly studied across an entire year. Data are collected through cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological testing, neuroimaging, bio-sampling, questionnaires, ecological momentary assessment, and real-world assessments using wearable devices. These data will become an accessible resource for the scientific community enabling the next step in understanding the human brain and how it dynamically and individually operates in its bio-social context. An access procedure to the collected data and bio-samples is in place and published on https://www.healthybrainstudy.nl/en/data-and-methods/access.Trail registration: https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7955."

Recently, the confluence of variational inference and deep learning has led to powerful and flexible automatic inference methods that can be trained by stochastic gradient descent. In particular, normalizing flows are highly parameterized deep models that can fit arbitrarily complex posterior densities. However, normalizing flows struggle in highly structured probabilistic programs as they need to relearn the forward-pass of the program. Automatic structured variational inference (ASVI) remedies this problem by constructing variational programs that embed the forward-pass. Here, we combine the flexibility of normalizing flows and the prior-embedding property of ASVI in a new family of variational programs, which we named cascading flows. A cascading flows program interposes a newly designed highway flow architecture in between the conditional distributions of the prior program such as to steer it toward the observed data. These programs can be constructed automatically from an input probabilistic program and can also be amortized automatically. We evaluate the performance of the new variational programs in a series of structured inference problems. We find that cascading flows have much higher performance than both normalizing flows and ASVI in a large set of structured inference problems."

Theoretical research has shown how neural networks can operate at different dynamic ranges that correspond to specific types of information processing. Here we present a data analysis framework that uses a linearized model of these dynamic states in order to decompose the measured neural signal into a series of components that capture both rhythmic and non-rhythmic neural activity. The method is based on stochastic differential equations and Gaussian process regression. Through computer simulations and analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the method in identifying meaningful modulations of oscillatory signals corrupted by structured temporal and spatiotemporal noise. These results suggest that the method is particularly suitable for the analysis and interpretation of complex temporal and spatiotemporal neural signals."

Recent developments provide a direct way to sample from the G‐Wishart distribution, which allows for more efficient algorithms for model selection than previously possible. Still, estimating Gaussian graphical models with more than a handful of variables remains a nearly infeasible task. Here, we propose two novel algorithms that use the direct sampler to more efficiently approximate the posterior distribution of the Gaussian graphical model. The first algorithm uses conditional Bayes factors to compare models in a Metropolis–Hastings framework. The second algorithm is based on a continuous time Markov process. We show that both algorithms are substantially faster than state‐of‐the‐art …"

We apply sparse OPLS to the reconstruction of presented images from BOLD response in primary visual cortex.

This study aimed to dissociate between these theories by investigating the direction of information flow prior to a perceptual switch, using Granger causality on classifier output originating from occipital, temporal, parietal and frontal regions of interest. The results point toward increased top-down information flow between temporal and occipital areas before a switch in dominance.

This area was previously found to be sensitive to audiovisual congruency. However, the direction of this congruency effect (i.e., stronger or weaker activity for congruent compared to incongruent stimulation) has been more equivocal. Here, we used fMRI to look at the neural responses of human participants during the McGurk illusion—in which auditory /aba/ and visual /aga/ inputs are fused to perceived /ada/—in a large homogenous sample of participants who consistently experienced this illusion. This enabled us to compare the neuronal responses during congruent audiovisual stimulation with incongruent audiovisual stimulation leading to the McGurk illusion while avoiding the possible confounding factor of sensory surprise that can occur when …"

            "abstract": "Population receptive field (pRF) mapping is an important asset for cognitive neuroscience. The pRF model is used for estimating retinotopy, defining functional localizers and to study a vast amount of cognitive tasks. In a classic pRF, the cartesian location and receptive field size are modeled as a 2D Gaussian kernel in visual space and are estimated by optimizing the fit between observed responses and predicted responses. In the standard framework this is achieved using an iterative gradient descent algorithm. This optimization is time consuming because the number of pRFs to fit (e.g., fMRI voxels) is typically large. This computation time increases further with the complexity of the pRF model (e.g., adding HRF parameters, surround suppression and uncertainty measures). Here, we introduce DeepRF, which uses deep convolutional neural networks to estimate pRFs. We compare the performance of DeepRF with that of the conventional method using a synthetic dataset for which the ground truth is known and an empirical dataset. We show that DeepRF achieves state-of-the-art performance while being more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than the conventional method. This enables easier and faster modeling of more complex pRF models, resolving an important limitation of the conventional approach."

Despite this, with the exception of the C. elegans roundworm, no definitive connectome has been established for any species. In order to obtain this, tracer studies are particularly appealing, as these have proven highly reliable. The downside of tract tracing is that it is costly to perform, and can only be applied ex vivo. In this paper, we suggest that instead of probing all possible connections, hitherto unknown connections may be predicted from the data that is already available. Our approach uses a ‘latent space model’ that embeds the connectivity in an abstract physical space. Regions that are close in the latent space have a high chance of being connected, while regions far apart are most likely disconnected in the connectome. After learning the latent embedding from the connections that we did observe, the latent space allows us to predict connections that have not been probed previously. We apply the methodology to two connectivity data sets of the macaque, where we demonstrate that the latent space model is successful in predicting unobserved connectivity, outperforming two baselines and an alternative model in nearly all cases. Furthermore, we show how the latent spatial embedding may be used to integrate multimodal observations (i.e. anterograde and retrograde tracers) for the mouse neocortex. Finally, our probabilistic approach enables us to make explicit …"

Dynamic limited-memory influence diagrams (DLIMIDs) are a new type of model proposed recently for this kind of problems. DLIMIDs are similar to other models in assuming a multi-stage process that satisfies the Markov property, ie, that the future is independent of the past given the current state. The main difference with those models is the restriction of limited memory, which means that the decision maker must make a choice based only on recent observations, but this limitation can be circumvented by the use of memory variables. We present several algorithms for evaluating DLIMIDs, show a real-world model for a medical problem, and compare DLIMIDs with related formalisms, such as LIMIDs, dynamic influence diagrams, and POMDPs."

We hypothesized that there are confounding orientation-dependent fixational eye movements (e.g., microsaccades), which systematically alter brain activity, and hence can be the source of decodable information.

The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the analysis of measured brain signals."

As such, it is widely used in computational neuroimaging studies that aim to build models to predict stimulus-induced neural responses in visual cortex. A popular method is population receptive field (PRF) mapping, which is able to characterize responses to a large range of stimuli. For each voxel, the PRF method estimates the best fitting receptive field properties (such as location and size in the visual field) using a coarse–to–fine approach which minimizes, but not eliminates, the risk of returning a local minimum. Here, we provide a Bayesian approach to the PRF method based on the slice sampler. Using this approach, we provide estimates of receptive field properties while at the same time being able to quantify their uncertainty. We test the performance of conventional and Bayesian approaches on simulated and empirical data."

With the recent advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it has become possible to create a literal picture of a visual stimulus from the human brain. Most conventional decoders are based either on the input space or on a hand-designed feature space. An alternative to hand-designing a feature space is unsupervised feature learning, which has seen much success in computer vision. Here, we present a new decoder, which combines Bayesian inversion of voxel-based encoding models with unsupervised feature learning (independent component analysis). We validated our decoder by reconstructing images of handwritten digits from human brain activity measured using fMRI, with state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results show that the feature space has a substantial effect on the accuracy of the reconstructions, and independent component analysis provides an effective means to learn feature spaces for neural decoding in fMRI."

Here, we present a new method for reconstructing naturalistic images and videos from very large single-participant functional magnetic resonance imaging data that leverages the recent success of image-to-image transformation networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial information obtained from retinotopic mappings across the visual system. More specifically, we first determine what position each voxel in a particular region of interest would represent in the visual field based on its corresponding receptive field location. Then, the 2D image representation of the brain activity on the visual field is passed to a fully convolutional image-to-image network trained to recover the original stimuli using VGG feature loss with an adversarial regularizer. In our experiments, we show that our method offers a significant improvement over existing video reconstruction techniques."

The long time spans over which prior knowledge is acquired make it a challenging question to investigate experimentally. In order to guide future experiments with clear empirical predictions, we used a neural network model to learn two commonly used tasks in the experimental literature (i.e. orientation classification and orientation estimation) where the prior probability of observing a certain stimulus is manipulated.

Mice use a large repertoire of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in different social contexts, for instance courtship, territorial dispute, dominance and mother-pup interaction. Previous studies have pointed to differences in the USVs in different context, sexes, strains and individuals, however, in many cases the outcomes of the analyses remained inconclusive.We here provide a more general approach to automatically classify USVs using deep neural networks (DNN). We classified the sex of the emitting mouse (C57Bl/6) based on the vocalization’s spectrogram, reaching unprecedented performance (~84% correct) in comparison with other techniques (Support Vector Machines: 64%, Ridge regression: 52%). Vocalization characteristics of individual mice only contribute mildly, and sex-only classification reaches ~78%. The performance can only partially be explained by a set of classical shape features, with duration, volume and bandwidth being the most useful predictors. Splitting estimation into two DNNs, from spectrograms to features (57-82%) and features to sex (67%) does not reach the single-step performance.In summary, the emitter’s sex can be successfully predicted from their spectrograms using DNNs, excelling over other classification techniques. In contrast to previous research, this suggests that male and female vocalizations differ in their spectrotemporal structure, recognizable even in single vocalizations."

Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have made an impressive positive impact on the single image segmentation problem. In this paper, in order to further increase labeling accuracy, we propose a method for integrating short-term temporal information with structural scene information by using a conditional random field (CRF). In our proposed method, ConvNet prediction refinement was achieved by exploiting a fully connected CRF as a post-processing step. Our main contribution is focused on taking into account the scene dynamics in semantic image segmentation. For extracting these dynamics we used scene dense optical flow. Inference in this dynamic CRF will consider both scene appearance and dense optical flow information. We show that by utilizing temporal information, the accuracy of semantic image segmentation can be improved with a small incurring additional computational overhead. Our proposed method, achieved 64.5 average IoU score applied on the Cityscapes urban data set with 19 different semantic classes compared to 62.1 IoU when no optical flow information was employed."

            "abstract": "An important problem in the use of statistical learning methods for the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is how to link voxels that have been selected as features for classification to a structural interpretation. For example, it is well-known that l1 regularized classifiers give sparse solutions but the selected voxels are typically diffusely distributed throughout the measured volume and do not necessarily correspond to meaningful structures within the brain.In order to facilitate the mapping between functional and structural data we make use of groupwise regularization. In previous work [1], we have shown that groupwise regularization can be used to perform automated channel selection in EEG experiments and to perform transfer learning, where data for multiple subjects or sessions is combined in the learning process (which is relevant to fMRI analysis in its own right). Here, we demonstrate …"

Attention is both influenced through bottom-up stimulus properties as well as top-down task demands. The interaction of these two attention mechanisms is not yet fully understood. A parsimonious reconciliation posits that both processes serve the minimization of predictive uncertainty. We propose a recurrent generative neural network model that predicts a visual scene based on foveated glimpses. The model shifts its attention in order to minimize the uncertainty in its predictions. We show that the proposed model produces naturalistic eye movements focusing on informative stimulus regions. Introducing additional tasks modulates the saccade patterns towards task-relevant stimulus regions. The model’s saccade characteristics correspond well with previous experimental data in humans, providing evidence that uncertainty minimization could be a fundamental mechanisms for the allocation of visual attention."

Here, we propose a simple yet powerful image processing strategy for recognizing facial expressions with prosthetic vision, supporting communication and social interaction in the blind. A psychophysical study was conducted to investigate whether a landmark-based representation of facial expressions could improve emotion detection with prosthetic vision.

External cues (such as verbal cues or visual context) can boost recognition performance in such conditions. In this work, we build an artificial neural network to model the interaction between the object processing stream (OPS) and the cue. We study the effects of varying neural and representational capacities of the OPS on the performance boost provided by cue-driven feature-based feedback in the OPS. We observe that the feedback provides performance boosts only if the category-specific features about the objects cannot be fully represented in the OPS. This representational limit is more dependent on task demands than neural capacity. We also observe that the feedback scheme trained to maximise recognition performance boost is not the same as tuning-based feedback, and actually performs better than tuning-based feedback."

First, it describes how one can model the mapping between stimuli and responses in the human brain through the development of encoding models. Next, the chapter focuses on how the mapping from static naturalistic stimuli to neural responses can be realized using ANNs. It considers a special kind of multi‐layer perceptrons (MLPs) for learning word embeddings. A recent development is to train deep neural networks (DNNs) consisting of up to a thousand hidden layers.

If a DLIMID respects the first-order Markov assumption then it can be represented by 2TLIMIDS. Given that the treatment selection algorithm for LIMIDs, called single policy updating (SPU), can be infeasible even for small finite-horizon models, we propose two alternative algorithms for treatment selection with 2TLIMIDS. First, single rule updating (SRU) is a hill-climbing method inspired upon SPU which needs not iterate exhaustively over all possible policies at each decision node. Second, a simulated annealing algorithm can be used to avoid the local-maximum policies found by SPU and SRU."

We utilized background knowledge to improve Bayesian classifier performance, both in terms of classification accuracy and in terms of modelling the structure of the underlying joint probability distribution. Relative differences between models of differing structural complexity, which were learnt using varying amounts of background knowledge, are explored. It is shown that the use of partial background knowledge may significantly improve the quality of the resulting …"

In this article, we present a new Bayesian-network learning algorithm which can be deployed as a tool for learning Bayesian networks, aimed at supporting the processes of prognosis or diagnosis. It is based on a maximum (conditional) mutual information criterion. The algorithm is evaluated using a high-quality clinical dataset concerning disorders of the liver and biliary tract, showing a performance which exceeds that of state-of-the-art Bayesian classifiers. Furthermore, the algorithm places less restrictions on classifying Bayesian network structures and therefore allows easier clinical interpretation."

IEEG data is unique as it provides extremely high-quality signals recorded directly from brain tissue. Applying advanced AI models to this data carries the potential to further our understanding of many fundamental questions in neuroscience. At the same time, as an invasive technique, iEEG lends itself well to long-term, mobile brain-computer interface applications, particularly for communication in severely paralyzed individuals.

Classical control theory is pushed to its limit when aiming to design control laws that are suitable for large-scale, complex neural systems. This work proposes a scalable, data-driven, unified approach to study brain-machine-environment interaction using established tools from dynamical systems, optimal control theory, and deep learning.To unify the methodology, we define the environment, neural system, and prosthesis in terms of differential equations with learnable parameters, which effectively reduce to recurrent neural networks in the discrete-time case. Drawing on tools from optimal control, we describe three ways to train the system: Direct optimization of an objective function, oracle-based learning, and reinforcement learning. These approaches are adapted to different assumptions about knowledge of system equations, linearity, differentiability, and observability.We apply the proposed framework to train an in-silico neural system to perform tasks in a linear and a nonlinear environment, namely particle stabilization and pole balancing. After training, this model is perturbed to simulate impairment of sensor and motor function. We show how a prosthetic controller can be trained to restore the behavior of the neural system under increasing levels of perturbation.We expect that the proposed framework will enable rapid and flexible synthesis of control algorithms for neural prostheses that reduce the need for in-vivo testing.

            "abstract": "Blindness affects millions of people around the world, and is expected to become increasingly prevalent in the years to come. For some blind individuals, a promising solution to restore a form of vision are cortical visual prostheses, which convert camera input to electrical stimulation of the cortex to bypass part of the impaired visual system. Due to the constrained number of electrodes that can be implanted, the artificially induced visual percept (a pattern of localized light flashes, or ‘phosphenes’) is of limited resolution, and a great portion of the field’s research attention is devoted to optimizing the efficacy, efficiency, and practical usefulness of the encoding of visual information. A commonly exploited method is the non-invasive functional evaluation in sighted subjects or with computational models by making use of simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) pipelines. Although the SPV literature has provided us with some fundamental insights, an important drawback that researchers and clinicians may encounter is the lack of realism in the simulation of cortical prosthetic vision, which limits the validity for real-life applications. Moreover, none of the existing simulators address the specific practical requirements for the electrical stimulation parameters. In this study, we developed a PyTorch-based, fast and fully differentiable phosphene simulator. Our simulator transforms specific electrode stimulation patterns into biologically plausible representations of the artificial visual percepts that the prosthesis wearer is expected to see. The simulator integrates a wide range of both classical and recent clinical results with neurophysiological evidence in humans and non …"

            "abstract": "Visual representations can be generated via feedforward or feedback processes. The extent to which these processes result in overlapping representations remains unclear. Previous work has shown that imagined stimuli elicit similar representations as perceived stimuli throughout the visual cortex. However, while representations during imagery are indeed only caused by feedback processing, neural processing during perception is an interplay of both feedforward and feedback processing. This means that any overlap could be due to overlap in feedback processes. In the current study we aimed to investigate this issue by characterizing the overlap between feedforward-and feedback-initiated category-representations during imagery, conscious perception and unconscious processing using fMRI. While all three conditions elicited stimulus representations in left lateral occipital cortex (LOC), significant similarities were only observed between imagery and conscious perception in this area. Furthermore, PPI-analyses revealed stronger connectivity between frontal areas and left LOC during conscious perception and imagery compared to unconscious processing. Together, these findings can be explained by the idea that long-range feedback modifies visual representations, thereby reducing neural overlap between purely feedforward and feedback-initiated stimulus representations measured by fMRI. Neural representations caused by feedback, either stimulus-driven (perception) or internally-driven (imagery), are however relatively similar."

To this end, we embrace the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the earliest step of our neural decoding pipeline by acquiring functional magnetic resonance imaging data as subjects perceived face images created by the generator network of a GAN. Subsequently, we used a linear decoding approach to predict the latent state of the GAN from brain data. Hence, latent representations that are needed for stimulus (re-) generation are obtained, leading to ground-breaking image reconstructions. Altogether, we have developed a highly promising approach for decoding neural representations of real-world data, which may pave the way for systematically analyzing neural information processing in the functional brain.Disclaimer: This manuscript contains no real face images; all faces are artificially generated by a generative adversarial network."

Recent work has shown that it is possible to predict perception of memorability, trustworthiness, intelligence and other attributes in human face images. The most successful of these approaches require face images expertly annotated with key facial landmarks. We demonstrate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that is able to perform the same task without the need for landmark features, thereby greatly increasing efficiency. The model has high accuracy, surpassing human-level performance in some cases. Furthermore, we use a deconvolutional approach to visualize important features for perception of 22 attributes and demonstrate a new method for separately visualizing positive and negative features."

The basic assumption in beamforming is that the sources are uncorrelated, which allows for estimating each source independent of the others. In this paper, we incorporate the independence assumption of the standard beamformer in a linear dynamical system, thereby introducing the dynamic beamformer. Using empirical data, we show that the dynamic beamformer outperforms the standard beamformer in predicting the condition of interest which strongly suggests that it also outperforms the standard method in localizing the active neural generators."

To unlock the full potential of phenotypic data, we developed PhenoScore: an open source, artificial intelligence-based phenomics framework. PhenoScore combines facial recognition technology with Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) data analysis to quantify phenotypic similarity at both the level of individual patients as well as of cohorts. We prove PhenoScore’s ability to recognize distinct phenotypic entities by establishing recognizable phenotypes for 25 out of 26 investigated genetic syndromes against clinical features observed in individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, PhenoScore was able to provide objective clinical evidence for two distinct ADNP-related phenotypes, that had already been established functionally, but not yet phenotypically. Hence, PhenoScore will not only be of use to unbiasedly quantify phenotypes to assist genomic variant interpretation at the individual level, such as for reclassifying variants of unknown clinical significance, but is also of importance for detailed genotype-phenotype studies."

However, currently, there are no open-source models that are feasible for use in clinical practice, which makes clinical application of these methods dependent on proprietary software.In this study, we therefore set out to compare three facial feature extraction methods when classifying 524 individuals with 18 different genetic disorders: two techniques based on convolutional neural networks (VGGFace2, OpenFace) and one method based on facial distances, calculated after detecting 468 landmarks. For every individual, all three methods are used to generate a feature vector of a facial image. These feature vectors are used as input to a Bayesian softmax classifier, to see which feature extraction method would generate the best results.Of the considered algorithms, VGGFace2 results in the best performance, as shown by its accuracy of 0.78 and significantly lowest loss. We inspect the features learned by VGGFace2 by generating activation maps and using Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, and confirm that the resulting predictors are interpretable and meaningful.All in all, the classifier using the features extracted by VGGFace2 shows not only superior classification performance, but detects faces in almost all images that are processed, in seconds. By not retraining VGGFace2, but instead using the feature vector of the network with its pretrained weights, we avoid overfitting the model. We confirm that it is possible to classify individuals with a rare …"

However, recently there has been an increasing interest from the computer vision community in analyzing personality from visual data. Recent computer vision approaches are able to accurately analyze human faces, body postures and behaviors, and use these information to infer apparent personality traits.

We use distance-dependent Chinese restaurant processes (dd-CRPs) to define a flexible prior which partitions the voxel measurements into clusters whose number and shapes are unknown a priori. With dd-CRPs we can conveniently implement spatial constraints to ensure that our parcellations remain spatially contiguous and thereby physiologically meaningful. In the present work, we extend CAESAR by using Gaussian process (GP) priors to model the temporally smooth haemodynamic signals that give rise to the measured FMRI data. A challenge for GP inference in our setting is the cubic scaling with respect to the number of time points, which can become computationally prohibitive with FMRI measurements, potentially consisting of long time series. As a solution we describe an efficient implementation that is practically as fast as the corresponding time-independent non-GP model with typically-sized FMRI data sets. We also employ a population Monte-Carlo algorithm that can significantly speed up convergence compared to traditional single-chain methods. First we illustrate the benefits of CAESAR and the GP priors with simulated experiments. Next, we demonstrate our approach by parcellating resting state FMRI data measured from twenty participants as taken from the Human Connectome Project data repository. Results show that CAESAR affords highly robust and scalable whole-brain clustering of FMRI timecourses."

Such structure can be represented in the form of probability trees or Boolean polynomials. However, in order to make use of such representations in Bayesian inference, one needs to be able to represent them compactly within the inference engine. Recently, it was shown that potentials that exhibit functional dependence can be factorized efficiently by means of the introduction of hidden variables. Here we demonstrate how these techniques can be extended to represent compactly arbitrary distributions that do not exhibit this functional dependence."

A promising solution to restoring a form of vision for some individuals are cortical visual prostheses, which bypass part of the impaired visual pathway by converting camera input to electrical stimulation of the visual system. The artificially induced visual percept (a pattern of localized light flashes, or ‘phosphenes’) has limited resolution, and a great portion of the field’s research is devoted to optimizing the efficacy, efficiency, and practical usefulness of the encoding of visual information. A commonly exploited method is noninvasive functional evaluation in sighted subjects or with computational models by using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) pipelines. An important challenge in this approach is to balance enhanced perceptual realism, biologically plausibility, and real-time performance in the simulation of cortical prosthetic vision. We present a biologically plausible, PyTorch-based phosphene simulator that can run in real-time and uses differentiable operations to allow for gradient-based computational optimization of phosphene encoding models. The simulator integrates a wide range of clinical results with neurophysiological evidence in humans and non-human primates. The pipeline includes a model of the retinotopic organization and cortical magnification of the visual cortex. Moreover, the quantitative effects of stimulation parameters and temporal dynamics on phosphene characteristics are incorporated. Our results demonstrate the simulator’s suitability for both computational applications such as end-to-end deep learning-based prosthetic vision optimization as well as behavioral …"

Backpropagation of error (BP) is an example of such an approach and has proven to be a highly successful application of stochastic gradient descent to deep neural networks. We propose constrained parameter inference (COPI) as a new principle for learning. The COPI approach assumes that learning can be set up in a manner where parameters infer their own values based upon observations of their local neuron activities. We find that this estimation of network parameters is possible under the constraints of decorrelated neural inputs and top-down perturbations of neural states for credit assignment. We show that the decorrelation required for COPI allows learning at extremely high learning rates, competitive with that of adaptive optimizers, as used by BP. We further demonstrate that COPI affords a new approach to feature analysis and network compression. Finally, we argue that COPI may shed new light on learning in biological networks given the evidence for decorrelation in the brain."

Furthermore, our proposed method is more flexible, being applicable to any spiking neuron model, is conservative in how many parameters are required for implementation and can be deployed in an online-fashion with minimal computational overhead. These features, together with its biological plausibility, make it an attractive mechanism underlying weight inference at single synapses."

When it is not possible to transmit all the possibly relevant information to higher layers, due to a bottleneck, task-based modulation of early visual processing might be necessary. In this work, we report how the effectiveness of modulating the early processing stage of an artificial neural network depends on the information bottleneck faced by the network. The bottleneck is quantified by the number of tasks the network has to perform and the neural capacity of the later stage of the network. The effectiveness is gauged by the performance on multiple object detection tasks, where the network is trained with a recent multi-task optimization scheme. By associating neural modulations with task-based switching of the state of the network and characterizing when such switching is helpful in early processing, our results provide a functional perspective towards understanding why task-based modulation of early neural processes might be observed in the primate visual cortex"

Unfortunately, most GAN methods are susceptible to mode collapse, meaning that they tend to capture only a subset of the modes of the true distribution. A possible way of dealing with this problem is to use an ensemble of GANs, where (ideally) each network models a single mode. In this paper, we introduce a principled method for training an ensemble of GANs using semi-discrete optimal transport theory. In our approach, each generative network models the transportation map between a point mass (Dirac measure) and the restriction of the data distribution on a tile of a Voronoi tessellation that is defined by the location of the point masses. We iteratively train the generative networks and the point masses until convergence. The resulting k-GANs algorithm has strong theoretical connection with the k-medoids algorithm. In our experiments, we show that our ensemble method consistently outperforms baseline GANs."

Previous research has shown that imagining a stimulus prior to binocular presentation of rivalling stimuli increases the chance of perceiving the imagined stimulus. In this study we investigated how this effect interacts with bottom-up sensory input by comparing psychometric response curves for congruent and incongruent imagery in humans. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used, allowing us to simultaneously study group-level effects as well as effects for individual participants. We found strong effects of both imagery as well as its interaction with sensory evidence within individual participants. However, the direction of these effects were highly variable between individuals, leading to weak effects at the group level. This highlights the heterogeneity of conscious perception and emphasizes the need for individualized investigation of such complex cognitive processes."

NIF models represent neural information processing systems as coupled brain regions that each embody neural computations. These brain regions are coupled to observed data specific to that region via linear observation models. NIF models are trained via backpropagation, directly leveraging the neural signal as the loss. Trained NIF models are accessible for in silico analyses. Using a large-scale fMRI video stimulation dataset and a feed-forward convolutional neural network-based NIF model as an example we show that, in this manner, we can estimate models that learn meaningful neural computations and representations. Our framework is general in the sense that it can be used in conjunction with any neural recording techniques. It is also scalable, providing neuroscientists with a principled approach to make sense of high-dimensional neural datasets."

Especially in neuroscience, understanding the causal interactions between brain regions is of primary importance. A family of measures have been developed from the parametric implementation of the Granger criteria of causality based on the linear autoregressive modelling of the signals. We propose a new Bayesian method for linear model identification with a structured prior (GMEP) aiming to apply it as linear regression method in the context of the parametric Granger causal inference. GMEP assumes a Gaussian scale mixture distribution for the group sparsity prior and it enables flexible definition of the coefficient groups. Approximate posterior inference is achieved using Expectation Propagation for both the linear coefficients and the hyperparameters. GMEP is investigated both on simulated data and on empirical fMRI data in which we show how adding information on the sparsity structure of the coefficients positively improves the inference process. In the same simulation framework, GMEP is compared with others standard linear regression methods. Moreover, the causal inferences derived from GMEP estimates and from a standard Granger method are compared across simulated datasets of different dimensionality, density connection and level of noise. GMEP allows a better model identification and consequent causal inference when prior knowledge on the sparsity structure are integrated in the structured prior."

However, for many domains dataavailability is scarce such that the resulting classifiers show poor performance. Even if performance is acceptable, Bayesian classifier structures are highly restricted and may therefore be unintelligable to the user. In this paper we address both issues. In the first part, we explore the trade-offs between classifiers constructed from clinical background knowledge and classifiers learned from a small clinical dataset. It is shown that the construction of classifiers from (partial) background knowledge is a feasible approach. In the second part, we introduce a construction algorithm that allows for a less restricted classifier structure, allowing easier clinical interpretation."

They are correct that the psychological literature has described behavioral signatures of human vision that ANNs should but do not currently explain. A model of human vision should ideally explain all available neural and behavioral data, including the unprecedentedly rich data from naturalistic benchmarks as well as data from experiments designed to address specific psychological hypotheses. None of the current models (ANNs, handcrafted computational models, and abstractly described psychological theories) meet this challenge."

A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled representations explain increasingly more variance than the alternative representations over the ventral stream. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding."

However, these models typically disregard the temporal dynamics experimentally observed in these areas. For instance, alpha oscillations dominate the dynamics of the human visual cortex, yet the computational relevance of oscillations is rarely considered in artificial neural networks (ANNs). We propose an ANN that embraces oscillatory dynamics with the computational purpose of converting simultaneous inputs, presented at two different locations, into a temporal code. The network was trained to classify three individually presented letters. Post-training, we added semi-realistic temporal dynamics to the hidden layer, introducing relaxation dynamics in the hidden units as well as pulsed inhibition mimicking neuronal alpha oscillations. Without these dynamics, the trained network correctly classified individual letters but produced a mixed output when presented with two letters simultaneously, elucidating a bottleneck problem. When introducing refraction and oscillatory inhibition, the output nodes corresponding to the two stimuli activated sequentially, ordered along the phase of the inhibitory oscillations. Our model provides a novel approach for implementing multiplexing in ANNs. It further produces experimentally testable predictions of how the primate visual system handles competing stimuli."

Here we show that by learning the transition (forward) model from interaction, we can use it to drive the learning of an amortized policy. Hence, we revisit policy optimization in relation to the deep active inference framework and describe a modular neural network architecture that simultaneously learns the system dynamics from prediction errors and the stochastic policy that generates suitable continuous control commands to reach a desired reference position.

This frame-free sensor signals pixel-wise changes in light intensity and is characterized by a high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution. We demonstrate how these retina-derived characteristics are beneficial in the presence of difficult lighting, motion blur, and for removal of cluttered redundant background. The system is tested in scenarios pertinent to prosthetic vision …"

Previous work has focused on development of decoding models from isolated speech data with a clean background and multiple repetitions of the material. In this study, we describe a novel approach to speech decoding that relies on a generative adversarial neural network (GAN) to reconstruct speech from brain data recorded during a naturalistic speech listening task (watching a movie). We compared the GAN-based approach, where reconstruction was done from the compressed latent representation of sound decoded from the brain, with several baseline models that reconstructed sound spectrogram directly. We show that the novel approach provides more accurate reconstructions compared to the baselines. These results underscore the potential of GAN …"

            "abstract": "Many of the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have been fueled by the highly successful backpropagation of error (BP) algorithm, which efficiently solves the credit assignment problem in artificial neural networks. However, it is unlikely that BP is implemented in its usual form within biological neural networks, because of its reliance on non-local information in propagating error gradients. Since biological neural networks are capable of highly efficient learning and responses from BP trained models can be related to neural responses, it seems reasonable that a biologically viable approximation of BP underlies synaptic plasticity in the brain. Gradient-adjusted incremental target propagation (GAIT-prop or GP for short) has recently been derived directly from BP and has been shown to successfully train networks in a more biologically plausible manner. However, so far, GP has only been shown to work on relatively low-dimensional problems, such as handwritten-digit recognition. This work addresses some of the scaling issues in GP and shows it to perform effective multi-layer credit assignment in deeper networks and on the much more challenging ImageNet dataset."

Here we present a new method for reconstructing naturalistic images and videos from very large single-participant functional magnetic resonance data that leverages the recent success of image-to-image transformation networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial information obtained from retinotopic mappings across the visual system. More specifically, we first determine what position each voxel in a particular region of interest would represent in the visual field based on its corresponding receptive field location. Then, the 2D image representation of the brain activity on the visual field is passed to a fully convolutional image-to-image network trained to recover the original stimuli using VGG feature loss with an adversarial regularizer. In our experiments, we show that our method offers a significant improvement over existing video reconstruction techniques"

During social interaction recognizing the partner's sex is important, however, previous research remained inconclusive whether individual USVs contain this information.Using deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify the sex of the emitting mouse from the spectrogram we obtain unprecedented performance (77%, vs. SVM: 56%, Regression: 51%). Performance was even higher (85%) if the DNN could also use each mouse's individual properties during training, which may, however, be of limited practical value. Splitting estimation into two DNNs, spectrogram-to-features and features-to-sex (60%) failed to reach single-step performance. Extending the features by each USVs spectral line, frequency and time marginal in a semi-convolutional DNN resulted in a performance mid-way (64%). Analyzing the network structure suggests an increase in sparsity of activation and correlation with sex, specifically in the fully-connected layers. A detailed analysis of the USV structure, reveals a subset of male vocalizations characterized by a few acoustic features, while the majority of sex differences appear to rely on a complex combination of many features. The same network architecture was also able to achieve above-chance classification for cortexless mice, which were considered indistinguishable before.In summary, spectrotemporal differences between male and female USVs allow at least their partial classification, which enables sexual recognition between mice and automated attribution of USVs …"

Additionally we introduce a novel dataset called Video-MNIST to demonstrate the performance of our method. Our method significantly outperforms the conventional 3D convolution in the low data regime (1 to 5 videos per class). Finally, our model achieves competitive results in the high data regime (>10 videos per class) using up to 45% fewer parameters."

It has been shown that the direction of this so-called ‘covert attention’ can be decoded on a single-trial basis from EEG and MEG data. In this paper we explore the possibility of using covert attention as a paradigm for subject-independent brain-computer interfacing (BCI). We find that although there is an average decrease of classification performance by moving to subject-independent learning, good subjects tend to remain good, indicating that performance of our BCI system depends on the subject individual performance level rather than whether or not the BCI system is trained using data of the same subject. This suggests that a calibration session can be omitted, which cuts down preparation time and thereby increases the practical relevance of covert attention based BCIs."

However, these models are not maximally exploited as their behavior is often not well-understood. One approach is to employ qualitative probabilistic network theory in order to derive a qualitative characterization of causal independence models. In this paper we analyze the qualitative properties of causal independence models with binary random variables under the assumption that the exact probabilistic parameters are unknown. Qualitative properties are shown to follow from the characteristics of the Boolean function underlying the model. We make use of the equivalence between Boolean functions and well-formed formulas in order to discuss these properties in terms of Boolean polynomials. This high-level qualitative characterization is seen as more intuitive to domain experts and facilitates the use of causal …"

            "abstract": "The unprecedented availability of large-scale datasets in neuroscience has spurred the exploration of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) both as empirical tools and as models of natural neural systems. Their appeal lies in their ability to approximate arbitrary functions directly from observations, circumventing the need for cumbersome mechanistic modeling. However, without appropriate constraints, DNNs risk producing implausible models, diminishing their scientific value. Moreover, the interpretability of DNNs poses a significant challenge, particularly with the adoption of more complex expressive architectures. In this perspective, we argue for universal differential equations (UDEs) as a unifying approach for model development and validation in neuroscience. UDEs view differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable mathematical objects that can be augmented and trained with scalable deep learning techniques. This synergy facilitates the integration of decades of extensive literature in calculus, numerical analysis, and neural modeling with emerging advancements in AI into a potent framework. We provide a primer on this burgeoning topic in scientific machine learning and demonstrate how UDEs fill in a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience. We outline a flexible recipe for modeling neural systems with UDEs and discuss how they can offer principled solutions to inherent challenges across diverse neuroscience applications such as understanding neural computation, controlling neural systems, neural decoding, and normative modeling."

However, there are still uncertainties regarding the functional outcomes, which can depend on many design choices in the development. In visual prostheses with a head-mounted camera, a particularly challenging question is how to deal with the gaze-locked visual percept associated with spatial updating conflicts in the brain. The current study investigates a recently proposed compensation strategy based on gaze-contingent image processing with eye-tracking. Gaze-contingent processing is expected to reinforce natural-like visual scanning and reestablished spatial updating based on eye movements. The beneficial effects remain to be investigated for daily life activities in complex visual environments.

A promising solution to restoring a form of vision for some individuals are cortical visual prostheses, which bypass part of the impaired visual pathway by converting camera input to electrical stimulation of the visual system. The artificially induced visual percept (a pattern of localized light flashes, or 'phosphenes') has limited resolution, and a great portion of the field's research is devoted to optimizing the efficacy, efficiency, and practical usefulness of the encoding of visual information. A commonly exploited method is non-invasive functional evaluation in sighted subjects or with computational models by using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) pipelines. An important challenge in this approach is to balance enhanced perceptual realism, biologically plausibility, and real-time performance in the simulation of cortical prosthetic vision. We present a biologically plausible, PyTorch-based phosphene simulator that can run in real-time and uses differentiable operations to allow for gradient-based computational optimization of phosphene encoding models. The simulator integrates a wide range of clinical results with neurophysiological evidence in humans and non-human primates. The pipeline includes a model of the retinotopic organization and cortical magnification of the visual cortex. Moreover, the quantitative effects of stimulation parameters and temporal dynamics on phosphene characteristics are incorporated. Our results demonstrate the simulator's suitability for both computational applications such as end-to-end deep learning-based prosthetic vision optimization as well as behavioral …"

            "abstract": "Foraging for resources in an environment is a fundamental activity that must be addressed by any biological agent. Thus, modelling this phenomenon in simulations can enhance our understanding of the characteristics of natural intelligence. In this work, we present a novel approach to modelling this phenomenon in silico. We achieve this by using a continuous coupled dynamical system for modelling the system. The dynamical system is composed of three differential equations, representing the position of the agent, the agent's control policy, and the environmental resource dynamics. Crucially, the control policy is implemented as a neural differential equation which allows the control policy to adapt in order to solve the foraging task. Using this setup, we show that when these dynamics are coupled and the controller parameters are optimized to maximize the rate of reward collected, adaptive foraging emerges in the agent. We further show that the internal dynamics of the controller, as a surrogate brain model, closely resemble the dynamics of the evidence accumulation mechanism, which may be used by certain neurons of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex region in non-human primates, for deciding when to migrate from one patch to another. Finally, we show that by modulating the resource growth rates of the environment, the emergent behaviour of the artificial agent agrees with the predictions of the optimal foraging theory."

However, BP relies on two computationally distinct phases, does not provide a satisfactory explanation of biological learning, and can be challenging to apply for training of networks with discontinuities or noisy node dynamics. By comparison, node perturbation (NP) proposes learning by the injection of noise into the network activations, and subsequent measurement of the induced loss change. NP relies on two forward (inference) passes, does not make use of network derivatives, and has been proposed as a model for learning in biological systems. However, standard NP is highly data inefficient and unstable due to its unguided, noise-based, activity search. In this work, we investigate different formulations of NP and relate it to the concept of directional derivatives as well as combining it with a decorrelating mechanism for layer-wise inputs. We find that a closer alignment with directional derivatives, and induction of decorrelation of inputs at every layer significantly enhances performance of NP learning making it competitive with BP."

We isolate these aspects in an artificial dataset and reproduce effects with the state-of-the-art behavior recognition models.

To this end, multi-unit activity (MUA) of macaque visual cortex was recorded in a passive fixation task upon presentation of faces and natural images. We analyzed the relationship between MUA and latent representations of state-of-the-art deep generative models, including the conventional and feature-disentangled representations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) (i.e., z- and w-latents of StyleGAN, respectively) and language-contrastive representations of latent diffusion networks (i.e., CLIP-latents of Stable Diffusion). A mass univariate neural encoding analysis of the latent representations showed that feature-disentangled w representations outperform both z and CLIP representations in explaining neural responses. Further, w-latent features were found to be positioned at the higher end of the complexity gradient which indicates that they capture visual information relevant to high-level neural activity. Subsequently, a multivariate neural decoding analysis of the feature-disentangled representations resulted in state-of-the-art spatiotemporal reconstructions of visual perception. Taken together, our results not only highlight the important role of feature-disentanglement in shaping high-level neural representations underlying visual perception but also serve as an important benchmark for the future of neural coding.Neural coding seeks to understand how the brain represents the world by modeling the relationship between stimuli and internal neural representations thereof.

Our encoding analysis revealed that the -latent representations of feature-disentangled generative adversarial networks (GANs) were the most effective candidate for predicting neural responses to images. Importantly, the usage of synthesized yet photorealistic images allowed for superior control over these data as their underlying latent representations were known a priori rather than approximated post-hoc. As such, we leveraged this property in neural reconstruction of the perceived images. Taken together with the fact that the (unsupervised) generative models themselves were never optimized on neural data, these results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement and unsupervised training as driving factors in shaping neural representations."

This approach allows for investigation of information representation in different brain regions and time windows with greater spatial and temporal precision. Our results offer insights into the neural basis of visual perception, showing that V1 neurons represent texture and color, V4 neurons exhibit symmetric representations, and IT neurons reveal concept-like features. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to decode features at different layers of a neural network, with V1 more strongly correlated with initial layers and V4 and IT with deeper layers.

However, there are still uncertainties regarding the functional outcomes, which can depend on many design choices in the development. In visual prostheses with a head-mounted camera, a particularly challenging question is how to deal with the gaze-locked visual percept associated with spatial updating conflicts in the brain. A recently proposed compensation strategy is gaze-contingent image processing with eye-tracking, which enables natural visual scanning and reestablished spatial updating based on eye movements. The current study evaluates the benefits of gaze-contingent processing versus gaze-locked and gaze-ignored simulations in the context of mobility and orientation, using a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with sighted subjects. Compared to gaze-locked vision, gaze-contingent processing was found to improve the speed in all experimental tasks, as well as the subjective quality of vision. Similar or further improvements were found in a control condition that ignores gaze-depended effects, a simulation that is unattainable in the clinical reality. Our results suggest that gaze-locked vision and spatial updating conflicts can be debilitating for complex visually-guided activities of daily living such as mobility and orientation. Therefore, for prospective users of head-steered prostheses with an unimpaired oculomotor system, the inclusion of a compensatory eye-tracking system is strongly endorsed."

Classical control theory is pushed to its limit when aiming to design control laws that are suitable for large-scale, complex neural systems. This work proposes a scalable, data-driven, unified approach to study brain-machine-environment interaction using established tools from dynamical systems, optimal control theory, and deep learning. To unify the methodology, we define the environment, neural system, and prosthesis in terms of differential equations with learnable parameters, which effectively reduce to recurrent neural networks in the discrete-time case. Drawing on tools from optimal control, we describe three ways to train the system: Direct optimization of an objective function, oracle-based learning, and reinforcement learning. These approaches are adapted to different assumptions about knowledge of system equations, linearity, differentiability, and observability. We apply the proposed framework to train an in-silico neural system to perform tasks in a linear and a nonlinear environment, namely particle stabilization and pole balancing. After training, this model is perturbed to simulate impairment of sensor and motor function. We show how a prosthetic controller can be trained to restore the behavior of the neural system under increasing levels of perturbation. We expect that the proposed framework will enable rapid and flexible synthesis of control algorithms for neural prostheses that reduce the need for in-vivo testing. We further highlight implications for sparse …"

The usage of synthesized yet photorealistic reality by generative adversarial networks (GANs) allows for superior control over these data: the underlying feature representations that account for the semantics in synthesized data are known a priori and their relationship is perfect rather than approximated post-hoc by feature extraction models. We exploit this property in neural decoding of multi-unit activity responses that we recorded from the primate brain upon presentation with synthesized face images in a passive fixation experiment. The face reconstructions we acquired from brain activity were astonishingly similar to the originally perceived face stimuli. This provides strong evidence that the neural face manifold and the disentangled w-latent space conditioned on StyleGAN3 (rather than the z-latent space of arbitrary GANs or other feature representations we encountered so far) share how they represent the high-level semantics of the high-dimensional space of faces."

            "abstract": "Blindness affects millions of people around the world, and is expected to become an increasingly prevalent condition in the years to come. For some blind individuals, cortical visual prosthetics provide a promising solution to restoring vision, by converting camera input to electrical stimulation of the cortex to bypass part of the impaired visual system. Electrical stimulation in the primary visual cortex has been found to produce dots of light in the subject’s vision, called phosphenes. By evoking phosphenes in the right patterns, prosthesis wearers can be shown a representation of the outside world. As this representation has a limited resolution, visual prosthetics will need to rely on intelligent image processing algorithms that filter meaningful information from the visual surroundings. To optimise these processing strategies, non-invasive simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) can be used with sighted subjects or computational models. However, most SPV studies use highly simplified models of phosphene generation, limiting their validity for real-life applications. In this project, we developed a fast and fully differentiable phosphene simulator that transforms electrode stimulation patterns into biologically plausible representations of what the prosthesis wearer is expected to see. To achieve this, the simulator includes several computational models that take into account the visuotopic organisation of the cortex and the spread of activation in cortical tissue to determine phosphene locations and sizes. Several stimulation parameters are taken into account to model phosphene brightness and threshold values. Temporal dynamics are incorporated to allow for a …"

In this paper, we provide a framework for discontinuity-based designs using Bayesian model averaging and Gaussian process regression, which we refer to as ‘Bayesian nonparametric discontinuity design’, or BNDD for short. BNDD addresses the two major shortcomings in most implementations of such designs: overconfidence due to implicit conditioning on the alleged effect, and model misspecification due to reliance on overly simplistic regression models. With the appropriate Gaussian process covariance function, our approach can detect discontinuities of any order, and in spectral features. We demonstrate the usage of BNDD in simulations, and apply the framework to determine the effect of running for political positions on longevity, of the effect of an alleged historical phantom border in the Netherlands on Dutch voting behaviour, and of Kundalini Yoga meditation on heart rate."

            "abstract": "Neuroprosthetic implants are a promising technology for restoring some form of vision in people with visual impairments via electrical neurostimulation in the visual pathway. Although an artificially generated prosthetic percept is relatively limited compared with normal vision, it may provide some elementary perception of the surroundings, re-enabling daily living functionality. For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection. A simulated electrode resolution of 26 x 26 was found to provide sufficient information for mobility in a simple environment. Our results suggest that, for a lower number of implanted electrodes, the removal of background textures and within-surface gradients may be beneficial in theory. However, the deep learning-based implementation for surface boundary detection did not improve mobility performance in the current study. Furthermore, our findings indicate that, for a greater number of electrodes, the removal of within-surface gradients and background textures …"

            "abstract": "Neural prosthetics may provide a promising solution to restore visual perception in some forms of blindness. The restored prosthetic percept is rudimentary compared to normal vision and can be optimized with a variety of image preprocessing techniques to maximize relevant information transfer. Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a nontrivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments, we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The results of these proof-of-principle experiments illustrate the potential of end-to-end optimization for prosthetic vision. The presented approach is highly modular and our approach could be extended to automated dynamic optimization of prosthetic vision for everyday tasks, given any specific constraints, accommodating individual requirements of the end-user."

            "abstract": "Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) often rely on massive compute resources and remain notoriously sample inefficient. In contrast, the human brain is able to efficiently learn effective control strategies using limited resources. This raises the question whether insights from neuroscience can be used to improve current RL methods. Predictive processing is a popular theoretical framework which maintains that the human brain is actively seeking to minimize surprise. We show that recurrent neural networks which predict their own sensory states can be leveraged to minimise surprise, yielding substantial gains in cumulative reward. Specifically, we present the Predictive Processing Proximal Policy Optimization (P4O) agent; an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that applies predictive processing to a recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm by integrating a world model in its hidden state. P4O significantly outperforms a baseline recurrent variant of the PPO algorithm on multiple Atari games using a single GPU. It also outperforms other state-of-the-art agents given the same wall-clock time and exceeds human gamer performance on Seaquest, which is a particularly challenging environment in the Atari domain. Altogether, our work underscores how insights from the field of neuroscience may support the development of more capable and efficient artificial agents."

However, the 3DConv does not easily lend itself to explainable model decisions. To this end we introduce a novel and intrinsic approach, whereby all the aspects of the 3DConv are rendered explainable. Our approach proposes the temporally factorized 3D convolution (3TConv) as an interpretable alternative to the regular 3DConv. In a 3TConv the 3D convolutional filter is obtained by learning a 2D filter and a set of temporal transformation parameters, resulting in a sparse filter requiring less parameters. We demonstrate that 3TConv learns temporal transformations that afford a direct interpretation by analyzing the transformation parameter statistics on a model level. Our experiments show that in the low-data regime the 3TConv outperforms 3DConv and R(2+1)D while containing up to 77\\% less parameters."

To this end, we embrace the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the earliest step of our neural decoding pipeline by acquiring functional magnetic resonance imaging data as subjects perceived face images created by the generator network of a GAN. Subsequently, we used a decoding approach to predict the latent state of the GAN from brain data. Hence, latent representations for stimulus (re-)generation are obtained, leading to state-of-the-art image reconstructions. Altogether, we have developed a highly promising approach for decoding sensory perception from brain activity and systematically analyzing neural information processing in the human brain."

As our construction shows, the proposed distribution relies on a latent Beta process controlling both the orders and outgoing connection probabilities of the nodes, and yields a probability distribution on sparse infinite graphs. The main advantage of the ICP over previously proposed Bayesian nonparametric priors for DAG structures is its greater flexibility. To the best of our knowledge, the ICP is the first Bayesian nonparametric model supporting every possible DAG involving latent nodes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ICP on learning the structure of deep generative sigmoid networks as well as convolutional neural networks."

Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to perform automated personality attribution (e.g., job interviews). It is important that we understand the driving factors behind the predictions, in humans and in deep neural networks. This paper explicitly studies the effect of the image background on apparent personality prediction while addressing two important confounds present in existing literature; overlapping data splits and including facial information in the background. Surprisingly, we found no evidence that background information improves model predictions for apparent personality traits. In fact, when background is explicitly added to the input, a decrease in performance was measured across all models."

BNDD addresses the two major shortcomings in most implementations of such designs: overconfidence due to implicit conditioning on the alleged effect, and model misspecification due to reliance on overly simplistic regression models. With the appropriate Gaussian process covariance function, our approach can detect discontinuities of any order, and in spectral features. We demonstrate the usage of BNDD in simulations, and apply the framework to determine the effect of running for political positions on longevity, of the effect of an alleged historical phantom border in the Netherlands on Dutch voting behaviour, and of Kundalini Yoga meditation on heart rate."

Estimating causal connectivity between spiking neurons from measured spike sequences is one of the main challenges of systems neuroscience. This semi-analytic method exploits the tractability of GP regression when the membrane potential is observed. The resulting posterior is then marginalized analytically in order to obtain the posterior of the response functions given the spike sequences alone. We validate our methods on both simulated data and real neuronal recordings."

Attention is both influenced through bottom-up stimulus properties as well as top-down task demands. The interaction of these two attention mechanisms is not yet fully understood. A parsimonious reconciliation posits that both processes serve the minimization of predictive uncertainty. We propose a recurrent generative neural network model that predicts a visual scene based on foveated glimpses. The model shifts its attention in order to minimize the uncertainty in its predictions. We show that the proposed model produces naturalistic eye-movements focusing on salient stimulus regions. Introducing the additional task of classifying the stimulus, modulates the saccade patterns and enables effective image classification. Given otherwise equal conditions, we show that different task requirements cause the model to focus on distinct, task-relevant regions. The results provide evidence that uncertainty minimization could be a fundamental mechanisms for the allocation of visual attention."

Previous research has shown that imagining a stimulus prior to binocular presentation of rivalling stimuli increases the chance of perceiving the imagined stimulus. In this study we investigated how this effect interacts with bottom-up sensory input by comparing psychometric response curves for congruent and incongruent imagery in humans. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used, allowing us to simultaneously study group-level effects as well as effects for individual participants. We found strong effects of both imagery as well as its interaction with sensory evidence within individual participants. However, the direction of these effects were highly variable between individuals, leading to weak effects at the group level. This highlights the heterogeneity of conscious perception and emphasizes the need for individualized investigation of such complex cognitive processes."

            "abstract": "Eye movements are an integral part of human perception, yet in many magneto-encephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies people try to minimize them, because of the large artifacts they can induce in the signal. Most studies lack a good control check to verify whether eye movements are causing an effect found in the MEG signal. Therefore, it remains unclear how much of an influence eye movements can have on observed effects in MEG. We find that we can decode stimulus location from eye movements in two different stages of a working memory match-to-sample task that encompass different areas of research typically done with MEG. This means that  the observed MEG effect might be (partly) due to eye movements instead of any true neural correlate. We suggest how to check for eye movement effects in your data and make suggestions on how to minimize eye movement artifacts from occurring in the first place."

Im Forschungsgebiet des „Brain-Reading” (wörtlich: Gehirnlesen) wird untersucht, inwiefern es möglich ist, aus den Hirnprozessen einer Person auf ihre Gedankeninhalte zu schließen. Die Grundidee ist, dass jeder Gedanke mit einem charakteristischen Aktivierungsmuster im Gehirn einhergeht. Trainiert man einen Computer darauf, solche Muster zu erkennen, wird es möglich, die Gedanken einer Person allein aus der Hirnaktivität auszulesen. Bereits heute sind eine Reihe verschiedener Gedanken ausgelesen worden. Dazu zählen visuelle Wahrnehmungen und Vorstellungen, Erinnerungen, Absichten, Gefühle und Trauminhalte.

In this paper we introduce two nonparametric Bayesian methods for spike-membrane and spike-spike causal connectivity based on Gaussian process regression. For spike-spike connectivity, we derive a new semi-analytic variational approximation of the response functions of a non-linear dynamical model of interconnected neurons. This semi-analytic method exploits the tractability of GP regression when the membrane potential is observed. The resulting posterior is then marginalized analytically in order to obtain the posterior of the response functions given the spike sequences alone. We validate our methods on both simulated data and real neuronal recordings."

We provide new intuitions based on earlier results by An et al. (2015) by deriving an upper bound on the number of nodes in networks with two hidden layers such that linear separability can be achieved. Concretely, we show that if the data can be described in terms of N finite sets and the used activation function f is non-constant, increasing and has a left asymptote, we can derive how many nodes are needed to linearly separate these sets. This will be an upper bound that depends on the structure of the data. This structure can be analyzed using an algorithm. For the leaky rectified linear activation function, we prove separately that under some conditions on the slope, the same number of layers and nodes as for the aforementioned activation functions is sufficient. We empirically validate our claims."

During perception, visual activity is characterized by distinct processing stages, but the temporal dynamics underlying imagery remain unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of visual imagery in human participants using magnetoencephalography. Firstly, we show that, compared to perception, imagery decoding becomes significant later and representations at the start of imagery already overlap with later time points. This suggests that during imagery, the entire visual representation is activated at once or that there are large differences in the timing of imagery between trials. Secondly, we found consistent overlap between imagery and perceptual processing around 160 ms and from 300 ms after stimulus onset. This indicates that the N170 gets reactivated during imagery and that imagery does not rely on early perceptual representations. Together, these results provide important insights for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of visual imagery."

            "abstract": "This workshop explores the interface between cognitive neuroscience and recent advances in AI fields that aim to reproduce human performance such as natural language processing and computer vision, and specifically deep learning approaches to such problems. When studying the cognitive capabilities of the brain, scientists follow a system identification approach in which they present different stimuli to the subjects and try to model the response that different brain areas have of that stimulus. The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning. In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves."

Recent work has shown that it is possible to predict perception of memorability, trustworthiness, intelligence and other attributes in human face images. The most successful of these approaches requires face images expertly annotated with key facial landmarks. We demonstrate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that is able perform the same task without the need for landmark features thereby greatly increasing efficiency. The model has high accuracy, surpassing human level performance in some cases. Furthermore, we use a deconvolutional approach to visualize important features for perception of 22 attributes and show that these can be described as a composites of their positive and negative components by separately visualizing both."

            "abstract": "According to most theories perceptual switching during binocular rivalry is caused by competition between the neural representations of the two input images. It remains unclear whether competition is resolved already at the early stages of visual processing and that information about the dominant percept is then fed forward to more higher-level areas or whether competition is first resolved in high-level areas and then fed back to lower-levels. This study aimed to dissociate between these ideas by investigating the direction of information prior to a perceptual switch, using Granger causality on classifier output from temporal and occipital ROIs. The results point towards increased top-down information flow between temporal and occipital areas before a switch in dominance. These findings are in line with high-level and hybrid explanations of binocular rivalry."

In this study, we explore whether words can be generated from neural activity patterns that reflect the perception of individual characters. To this end, we developed a graphical model where low-level properties of individual characters are represented via Gaussian mixture models and high-level properties reflecting character co-occurrences are represented via a hidden Markov model.

However, they have a tendency to yield unstable solutions in the case of short-events sequences. There are solutions based on regularization, e.g. smooth FIR (sFIR), but at the cost of a regularization penalty and prior knowledge, thus breaking the blind principle. In this study, we show that spreading codes (scFIR) outperforms FIR and sFIR in short-events sequences, thus enabling the blind and dynamic estimation of the HRF without numerical instabilities and the regularization penalty. The scFIR approach was applied in short-events sequences of simulated and experimental functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In general terms, scFIR performed the best with both simulated and experimental data. While FIR was unable to compute the blind estimation of two simulated target HRFs for the shortest sequences (15 and 31 events) and sFIR yielded shapes barely correlated with the targets, scFIR achieved a normalized correlation coefficient above 0.9. Furthermore, scFIR was able to estimate in a responsive way dynamic changes of the amplitude of a simulated target HRF more accurately than FIR and sFIR. With experimental fMRI data, the ability of scFIR to estimate the real HRF obtained from a training data set was superior in terms of correlation and mean-square error. The use of short-events sequences for the blind estimation of the HRF could benefit patients in terms of scanning time or intensity of magnetic field in clinical tests. Furthermore, short-events sequences could be used …"

This input is topographically organized and is likely to result in functionally specific signals. Such specificity can be examined using functional clustering approaches. Here, we propose a Bayesian model-based functional clustering approach, applied to resting state striatal functional MRI timecourses. Data from two sets of ten participants were used to obtain parcellations and examine their robustness. This stable clustering was used to initialize a more constrained model in order to obtain individualized parcellations in 57 additional participants. Resulting cluster time courses were used to examine functional connectivity between clusters and related to the rest of the brain in a GLM analysis.We find six distinct clusters in each hemisphere, with clear interhemispheric correspondence and functional relevance. These clusters exhibit functional connectivity profiles that further underscore their homologous nature and are consistent with existing notions on segregation and integration in parallel cortico-basal ganglia loops. Our findings suggest that multiple territories within both the affective and motor regions can be distinguished solely using resting state functional MRI from these regions."

I will argue that these nonlinear transformations can be estimated independent of brain data using statistical approaches. Decoding based on the resulting feature space is shown to yield better results than those obtained using a hand-designed feature space based on Gabor wavelets. I will discuss how alternative feature spaces that are either learned or hand-designed can be compared with one another, thereby …"

The models also worked together in a committee to create and manage a portfolio for over a decade, the return of the portfolio was above the average return of the population. There was however a survivorship bias in the data which has a considerable effect on the average population performance.

While this approach was recently shown to improve prediction of human brain activity in response to natural images, it has two problems.

There are different ways of approaching this, one of them is to cluster together brain regions that show similar structural connectivity patterns. The resulting clusters are taken to represent functionally distinct areas of the brain based on the assumption that structure and function are intimately related. In this thesis, structural connectivity data of the brain was used to compare two Bayesian clustering algorithms: the Infinite Relational model and Bayesian Community Detection. The maximum a posteriori estimates of twenty subjects, required by simulated annealing, were used to compare both models. It was found that Bayesian Community Detection produces significantly more clusters than the Infinite Relational Model while at the same time performing just as well as the Infinite Relational Model in terms of reproducibility."

We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance.Approach: We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a covert orientation discrimination task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3.5 u) or far (7u) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block.Main Results: Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1.85 s and 2.25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65.9%) than in the easy task condition (61.1%). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate.Significance: Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand. Further research is …"

            "abstract": "Repeated reactivation of recently acquired information has been put forward as a candidate mechanism supporting long-term memory consolidation. Evidence from rodent electrophysiology studies suggests that the hippocampus plays a central role in coordinating the reactivation of neocortical memory representations during post-encoding offline periods. However, evidence from human neuroimaging studies is scarce and it remains unclear at which timescales offline memory reactivation occurs. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate changes in the resting-state brain connectivity pattern following a sequence learning task. Participants were required to remember several multi-item sequences, comprising alternating face and scene or faceless body stimuli. Preliminarily results suggest learning-induced changes in fMRI and source space MEG resting-state connectivity when comparing post-encoding rest with preexperimental baseline periods. Specifically, we observe increased correlation between the hippocampus and specialized ventral visual regions processing the categorical sequence stimuli.  Moreover, the stimulus-specific connectivity pattern across regions during encoding appears to show increased similarity to the connectivity pattern observed during post-encoding relative to the baseline rest period. These preliminary findings are in line with evidence suggesting hippocampus mediated neocortical reactivation of recently acquired information during subsequent offline periods. By comparing learning-induced changes in resting-state connectivity …"

Functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI is an extension of MRI to measure quick and tiny metabolic changes that take place in the active brain. Thus, fMRI studies are capable of providing not only an anatomical view of the brain, but a minute-to-minute recording of actual brain activity based on blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes related to neuronal activity across the entire brain. The ability of fMRI to track changes in the neuronal activity has proved very useful in localizing task related brain activations and hence in the functional mapping of brain."

One approach is to employ qualitative probabilistic network theory in order to derive a qualitative characterisation of causal independence models. In this paper we exploit polynomial forms of Boolean functions to systematically analyse causal independence models, giving rise to the notion of a polynomial causal independence model. The advantage of the approach is that it allows understanding qualitative probabilistic behaviour in terms of algebraic structure."

However, the construction of such networks is non-trivial as it requires the specification of all the dependencies and independences between domain variables together with the assessment of an often huge number of conditional probabilities, quantifying those dependencies.

We hope that this discussion of modeling issues will serve as a guideline to the construction of future probabilistic models."

            "abstract": "MethodsNeural population model. Our neural population model has a feedforward architecture consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer (Fig. 1). The input layer consists of a group of 50 independent Poisson neurons that respond to a stimulus, s, with firing rates, r=[r1,..., rN], each generated from its own independent Poisson distribution 11. The probability that neuron i responds with firing rate ri is given by where the rate parameter i is determined by Gaussian tuning curves fi (s), specific for each input neuron, scaled with a global contrast parameter c, ie i= cfi (s). The Gaussian input tuning curves for each neuron are thus given by where the maxima of the tuning curves, φ=[φ1,..., φN], were uniformly distributed over a range of− 20 to 20 and the width of every tuning curve was given by σ2= 10. The contrast parameter, c, determined the quality of the stimuli. The range of contrasts used depended on the task and is specified in the task descriptions below. The hidden layer was densely connected to the input layer with weights, W, and consisted of, K= 200, rectified linear units (ReLUs) with bias parameters bk and firing rates h=[h1,..., hK] for 1≤ k≤ K. The output layer of the network was densely connected to the hidden layer via output weights, U, and consisted either of two units, one for every class, in the classification task (Fig. 1 A), or a single unit, in the stimulus estimation task (Fig. 1 D). A softmax function was applied to the output units of the classification task to convert them to probabilities.In some experiments a cue was added to indicate which class was more likely to occur on a certain trial.

            "abstract": "Blindness is a common societal problem that affects day-to-day functioning. Even though there is no effective treatment yet, there are some alternative ways such as neuroprosthetic visual implants. Although prosthetic vision does not provide normal vision, it does provide a rudimentary form of the environment through point-like flashes known as phosphenes which might still help basic activities like navigation. However, due to biological limitations, the current implants have low resolution. The limited capacity of resolution increases the need for optimal information extraction from the scene for efficient understanding of the environment. In line with this, there is a need for better image pre-processing techniques.One limitation of the studies testing phosphene vision is the necessary surgical operation for implants. For this reason, researchers found other techniques to test phosphene vision. One solution is testing sighted participants with wearable head-mounted displays (eg, VR) that convert the real scene to processed phosphene vision. However, studies suggested that different image pre-processing techniques should be used for different contexts and scenes which requires an optimization adaptive to the scene. The variability in parameters to be tested and the need for optimization raise other challenges such as significantly increased number of tests for optimization problems which also means increased cost."

Twenty-six regions of interest (ROIs) in the visual cortex were defined based on the HCP MMP 1.0 parcellation [1]. These ROIs were projected from the HCP MMP 1.0 parcellation to the native functional volumetric space via the fsaverage surface space, native surface space and native anatomical volumetric space. The analysis was performed on the average functional data of the two subjects. The data were averaged after further projecting each ROI from the native functional space of the individual subjects to a common functional space via hyperalignment [2].A ridge regression model per voxel was estimated on the training set. The regularization coefficients of the models were selected with leave-one-out crossvalidation. The models were evaluated on the test set. Model performance was defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted voxel responses."

            "abstract": "Neuroprosthetic implants are a promising technology for restoring some form of vision in people with visual impairments via electrical neurostimulation in the visual pathway. Although an artificially generated prosthetic percept is relatively limited compared with normal vision, it may provide some elementary perception of the surroundings, re-enabling daily living functionality. For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection. A simulated electrode resolution of 26× 26 was found to provide sufficient information for mobility in a simple environment. Our results suggest that, for a lower number of implanted electrodes, the removal of background textures and within-surface gradients may be beneficial in theory. However, the deep learning-based implementation for surface boundary detection did not improve mobility performance in the current study. Furthermore, our findings indicate that, for a greater number of electrodes, the removal of within-surface gradients and background textures …"

These measures require an estimate of whole-brain structural connectivity for which one may resort to deterministic or thresholded probabilistic streamlining procedures. While these procedures have provided important insights about the characteristics of human brain networks, they ultimately rely on unwarranted assumptions such as those of noise-free data or the use of an arbitrary threshold. Therefore, resulting structural connectivity estimates as well as derived graph measures fail to fully take into account the inherent uncertainty in the structural estimate. In this paper, we illustrate an easy way of obtaining posterior distributions over graph metrics using Bayesian inference. It is shown that this posterior distribution can be used to quantify uncertainty about graph-theoretical measures at the single subject level, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the graph-theoretical properties of human brain connectivity. We refer to this model-based approach to connectivity analysis as Bayesian connectomics."

With this development to ever-deeper architectures it raises the question why the brain has not developed such architecture. Besides wiring constraints we argue that the brain operates under different circumstances when performing object recognition, being confronted with noisy and ambiguous sensory input. The role of time in the process of object recognition is investigated, showing that a recurrent neural network is able to integrate evidence about an object’s identity over time. When trained with reinforcement learning the agent is able to learn the amount of time needed to come to an accurate estimate of the stimulus. The behavior and activity of the network are similar to findings from human and animal studies of perceptual decision-making."

            "citation": "",
            "author": "Adriana Birlutiu and Tjeerd MH Dijkstra and Marcel van Gerven and Tom Heskes",
            "abstract": "The malaria parasite has a direct influence on the immune system of its host, as witnessed by periodic fevers. It is unclear whether the host immune system has a direct influence on parasite gene expression. The parasite is known to secrete proteins that are thought to manipulate the host immune system. An open question is whether the malaria parasite regulates these proteins in response to immune system pressure. A recent study of Daily et al.[2] shows that in vivo parasite gene expression from 35 patients can be classified into three clusters. Besides expression data, Daily et al. collected sixteen patient characteristics, some of which are significantly different between the clusters (rank order test).We take an integrated probabilistic approach by predicting the malaria parasite cluster based on patient characteristics and their interactions. As the number of predictors (136) is larger than the number of patients, we use L1-regularized multinomial logistic regression. We find that the interaction of immune signaling molecules TNFα and TGFα explain cluster membership best, consistent with the notion that parasite gene expression reacts to immune system pressure."

            "abstract": "Brain computer interfacing (BCI) is a general term that is used for a direct connection between the brain and a computer [1]. In order to differentiate between task conditions, we need to perform classification of the measured brain signals. We have developed a classification module that is suited for off-line and on-line classification in BCIs which can be obtained from ftp://ftp. fcdonders. nl/pub/fieldtrip/modules/. The module implements existing classifiers such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, naive bayes, neural networks, and support vector machines. Additionally, the module implements two new classification methods based on groupwise regularization and regularization of differences, which are particularly suited for BCI. In order to evaluate our classification module, we used two BCI tasks: covert attention and imagined movement."
