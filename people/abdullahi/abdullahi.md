I am interested in the biological constraints and environmental pressures that drive organisation and information processing in the visual cortex. What aspects of the biological substrate play a key role in the formation of neural circuits and visual function? What visual representations do agents learn in a context in which they actively have to engage with their environment? In order to answer these questions, I aim to develop biologically-plausible neural network models that can solve visual problems in ecologically valid environments.
