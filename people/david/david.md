David is a PhD student at the Donders Centre for Cognition, co-advised by Marcel van Gerven and Max Hinne. His research focuses on developing probabilistic models that can efficiently and effectively solve real-world control problems in the face of uncertainty. As part of the Artificial and Cognitive systems lab, he is currently working on using Bayesian non-parametric models for reinforcement learning and model predictive control. When not doing research, he can be found playing guitar, running, or playing tennis.
