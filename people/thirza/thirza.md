Reinforcement learning is the problem where an agent must learn how to make decisions in an unknown world only based on incomplete sensory information. During my PhD project, I focus on constructing and navigating internal representations of procedurally generated environments with "dual variational control". Importantly, the uncertainty of the variational distribution serves as an intrinsic motivation for efficient exploration. That is, uncertainty about the world decreases with (smart) exploration, up until the moment where the agent knows how to act to get what it wants.
